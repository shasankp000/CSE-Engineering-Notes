# Important Resources to tackle CS overall

These resources are curated and assembled from a multitude of sources over my entire degree of BTech in Computer Science and Engineering. This will help you whether you happen to be in a shitty tier-3 college like myself or are lucky enough to be in a good top level university/college.

## Notes in PDF format

These are the same notes on the website, but in PDF format as well.

# YouTube Playlists (Applies to both MAKAUT students and CS students in general)


## Linear Algebra (Semester-1)

- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF-vWhgiaXWPZ7Ogw6zIZMg4aqUXEwrnJ (An old curated playlist by me to build up the basics of matrices and stuff from the ground from school level stuff).

- https://www.youtube.com/@visualkernel (only 4 videos related matrices and vectors but these are really high quality ones and are must watch, some topics overlap into math topics for ML, so people can choose and skip as these are divided into sections per video).
  
- Full linear algebra (matrices + vectors (for semester 1), by 3blue1brown a renowned legend for teaching mathematics for ML): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab
