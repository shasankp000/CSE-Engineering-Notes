# Introduction to Classification and Prediction -- The basics

## What is Classification?

Classification is all about **assigning labels** ==to data based on patterns it has learned from existing data==.

It‚Äôs like training your brain:

- If you see a four-legged furry animal that barks, you classify it as a **dog**.
- If it purrs, it‚Äôs a **cat**.

### **In Technical Terms:**

Given an input, classification answers:

> "Which **category** does this data belong to?"

### **Examples:**

| Scenario          | Classification Task                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Email Filtering   | Classify as `Spam` or `Not Spam`.              |
| Medical Diagnosis | Predict if a tumor is `Benign` or `Malignant`. |
| Image Recognition | Classify images into `Cat`, `Dog`, `Bird`.     |
| Credit Scoring    | `Good` or `Bad` credit risk.                   |

---
## **How Classification Works:**

1. **Training Phase:**  
    A model learns from **labeled data**.  

Example:

```css
[Height, Weight] ‚Üí [Label: Male or Female]
```

2. **Testing Phase:**  
    Model is given **new, unseen data** to predict the label.

---
## Popular Classification Algorithms:

| Algorithm                        | Idea                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decision Trees**               | Split data into branches based on rules.              |
| **Naive Bayes**                  | Based on probability and Bayes' theorem.              |
| **k-Nearest Neighbors**          | Classifies by looking at closest neighbors.           |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Finds the best boundary (hyperplane) between classes. |

---
## 2. What is Prediction?

Prediction is about **estimating a value** for new data based on past patterns.

Unlike classification, the output isn‚Äôt a **category** ‚Äî it‚Äôs usually a **numeric value**.

### **Examples:**

|Scenario|Prediction Task|
|---|---|
|Stock Market|Predict future stock price.|
|Weather Forecasting|Predict tomorrow's temperature.|
|House Pricing|Predict the selling price of a house.|

---

### **Difference between Classification & Prediction:**

| Feature     | Classification                | Prediction                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Output Type | **Category/Label** (discrete) | **Numeric Value** (continuous) |
| Example     | Spam or Not Spam              | Predicting stock price         |

---
### **Process for Both:**

1. **Data Collection**  
    Gather historical data.
    
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
    Clean, filter, normalize, and format.
    
3. **Model Building**  
    Train with algorithms.
    
4. **Evaluation**  
    Test the model using new data.
    
5. **Deployment**  
    Apply to real-world data.

# Cluster Analysis

**What is a cluster**?

==Cluster is a group of objects that belongs to the same class. In other words, similar objects are grouped in one cluster and dissimilar objects are grouped in another cluster==.

## What is Clustering?

Clustering is the process of making a group of abstract objects into classes of similar objects, such that:

- **Data points in the same cluster** are **similar** to each other.
- **Data points in different clusters** are **dissimilar**.

Think of it as **unsupervised learning** ‚Äî there are **no labels** like in classification.

**For example, consider a dataset of vehicles given in which it contains information about different vehicles like cars, buses, bicycles, etc. As it is unsupervised learning there are no class labels like Cars, Bikes, etc for all the vehicles, all the data is combined and is not in a structured manner.**

**Now our task is to convert the unlabelled data to labelled data and it can be done using clusters.**

**The main idea of cluster analysis is that it would arrange all the data points by forming clusters like cars cluster which contains all the cars, bikes clusters which contains all the bikes, etc.**

**Simply it is the partitioning of similar objects which are applied to unlabelled data.**

---
### **Simple Analogy:**

Imagine you walk into a room full of people at a party.  
Without knowing anyone‚Äôs names, you might group them like:

- People standing near the snacks.
    
- People deep in conversation.
    
- People dancing.

That‚Äôs **clustering**!  
You didn‚Äôt ask them who they were ‚Äî you just used patterns (behavior/location).

---
## Purpose of Clustering:

- Identify **natural groupings** in data.
    
- Simplify large datasets.
    
- Spot **outliers** or unusual patterns.
    
- Reveal hidden relationships.
---
## Requirements of Clustering in Data Mining

The following points throw light on why clustering is required in data mining ‚àí

- **Scalability**¬†‚àí ==We need highly scalable clustering algorithms== to deal with large databases.
    
- **Ability to deal with different kinds of attributes**¬†‚àí ==Algorithms should be capable to be applied on any kind of data such as interval-based (numerical) data, categorical, and binary data==.
    
- **Discovery of clusters with attribute shape**¬†‚àí ==The clustering algorithm should be capable of detecting clusters of arbitrary shape. They should not be bounded to only distance measures that tend to find spherical cluster of small sizes==.
    
- **High dimensionality**¬†‚àí ==The clustering algorithm should not only be able to handle low-dimensional data but also the high dimensional space==.
    
- **Ability to deal with noisy data**¬†‚àí Databases contain noisy, missing or erroneous data. Some algorithms are sensitive to such data and may lead to poor quality clusters.
    
- **Interpretability**¬†‚àí ==The clustering results should be interpretable, comprehensible, and usable==.
---
## **Common Clustering Algorithms:**

|Algorithm|Idea|Use Case Example|
|---|---|---|
|**K-Means**|Divides data into **K groups** based on closeness.|Customer Segmentation in marketing.|
|**Hierarchical Clustering**|Builds a **tree of clusters** (dendrogram).|Gene expression analysis in biology.|
|**DBSCAN**|Clusters based on **density** rather than distance.|Detecting fraud or network attacks.|

---

## **Steps in Clustering:**

1. **Select Features**  
    Choose which data points to group (e.g., income, age).
    
2. **Choose Similarity Measure**  
    Usually distance-based:
    
    - Euclidean Distance.
        
    - Manhattan Distance.
        
    - Cosine Similarity.
        
3. **Run Algorithm**  
    The algorithm assigns data points to clusters.
    
4. **Evaluate Quality**  
    Visualize or measure:
    
    - **Intra-cluster similarity** (tight groups).
        
    - **Inter-cluster dissimilarity** (clear separation).

---

## **Real-World Examples:**

|Field|Use of Clustering|
|---|---|
|Marketing|Segmenting customers based on buying patterns.|
|Healthcare|Grouping patients by symptoms or treatment response.|
|Astronomy|Classifying stars or galaxies.|
|Social Networks|Detecting communities or friend groups.|

---

## **Example: K-Means Clustering (Basic Idea)**

- You specify `K` (number of clusters).
    
- Algorithm randomly picks `K` centers.
    
- Each point is assigned to the nearest center.
    
- Centers are recalculated as the **mean** of assigned points.
    
- Repeat until the clusters stabilize.

---
# Types of Data in Cluster Analysis

**Types Of Data Used In Cluster Analysis Are:**

- **Interval-Scaled variables**
- **Binary variables**
- **Nominal, Ordinal, and Ratio variables**
- **Variables of mixed types**

## 1. Interval-Scaled variables

**Interval-scaled variables are continuous measurements of a roughly linear scale.  
  
Typical examples include weight and height, latitude and longitude coordinates (e.g., when clustering houses), and weather temperature.

**The measurement unit used can affect the clustering analysis. For example, changing measurement units from meters to inches for height, or from kilograms to pounds for weight, may lead to a very different clustering structure.**

**Why it matters:**  
Distance-based algorithms like **K-Means** work best here, since values have real physical meaning and mathematical operations make sense.

---
## 2. Binary variables

**Definition:**  
**A binary variable is a variable that can take only 2 values.** Typically:
  
`0` = Absence  
`1` = Presence

üìè Example:

- Gender (`Male` = 0, `Female` = 1)
    
- Has account: `Yes(1)` / `No(0)`

üí° **Similarity Measurement:**

- Use **Jaccard coefficient** or **Simple Matching** depending on whether 0 and 1 are equally important.

---
## 3. Categorical (Nominal) Variables.

**A generalization of the binary variable in that it can take more than 2 states, e.g., red, yellow, blue, green.** Labels or names without inherent numerical meaning.

 Example:

- Blood type: `A`, `B`, `AB`, `O`
- City names: `Delhi`, `Mumbai`, `Chennai`
- Product category: `Electronics`, `Furniture`, `Books`

 **Similarity Measurement:**

- Use **Hamming distance** or simple matching.

---
## 4. Ordinal Variables

Variables that have a **rank/order**, but the **distance between ranks** isn‚Äôt known or uniform.

**An ordinal variable can be discrete or continuous.**

Example:

- Customer satisfaction: `Poor`, `Average`, `Good`, `Excellent`
- Education level: `High School`, `Bachelor`, `Master`, `PhD`

**Handling:**  
You can convert them to numerical ranks, but **treat them carefully** to avoid distorting the meaning.  
e.g. `Poor = 1`, `Average = 2` ... but the "gap" between `1` and `2` isn‚Äôt always the same as between `2` and `3`.

---
## 5. Ratio-Scaled Intervals

Like interval data, but **ratios are meaningful** and values have a natural zero (can be initialized to zero by default).

Example:

- Weight
- Age (in exact years)
- Length
- Distance
- Salary

**Why important:**  
You can apply **multiplication/division** here.  
`A person earning $60K makes twice as much as someone earning $30K.`

---
## 6. Mixed-Type Variables

üëâ **Definition:**  
Datasets that contain a mix of all the above types.

üìè Example:

| Age (Interval) | Gender (Binary) | Job Type (Categorical) | Rating (Ordinal) |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 25             | Male (0)        | Engineer               | Good             |

üí° **Solution:**

- Normalize the numeric data.
- Use specialized similarity measures like **Gower‚Äôs Similarity Coefficient** for mixed data types.
---
## Why This Matters:

Different data types need different **distance metrics**:

|Data Type|Typical Similarity Measure|
|---|---|
|Interval/Ratio|Euclidean / Manhattan distance|
|Binary|Jaccard / Simple Matching|
|Categorical|Hamming distance / Matching coefficient|
|Ordinal|Spearman‚Äôs rank / Normalized distance|

---
# Types of Partitioning/Clustering methods

https://www.scaler.com/topics/data-mining-tutorial/partitioning-methods-in-data-mining/

## **Overview**

Partitioning methods split your dataset into a **fixed number of clusters** (`k` clusters, where `k` is defined before starting).

The goal is to:

- Assign each data point to **one and only one cluster**.
- Make clusters **internally cohesive** (data points are similar to each other) and **externally isolated** (different from other clusters).

## 1. K-Means Clustering

### Basic Idea:

Divides `n` objects into `k` clusters, where each object belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (called the **centroid**).

The K-Means algorithm begins by ==randomly assigning each data point to a cluster. It then iteratively refines the clusters' centroids until convergence. The refinement process involves calculating the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster and updating the cluster centroids' coordinates accordingly. The algorithm continues to iterate until convergence, meaning the cluster assignments no longer change==. K-means clustering aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster centroid.

Before we proceed further, let's understand about :

---
### What is a Centroid?

A **centroid** is the **geometric center** of a cluster.

![Pasted image 20250422125627.png](/img/user/media/Pasted%20image%2020250422125627.png)


Or 

![Pasted image 20250422125857.png](/img/user/media/Pasted%20image%2020250422125857.png)

One could say that the centroid of these clusters are the big white circles at the center, and in some cases, the green circles


It‚Äôs like the **average position** of all the points (data samples) assigned to that cluster.

For example :

Let‚Äôs say you have a 2D space where each data point is represented by coordinates:

|Point|X|Y|
|---|---|---|
|A|2|4|
|B|4|6|
|C|3|5|
If these three points belong to a single cluster, the centroid‚Äôs coordinates would be calculated like this:

$$Centroid_x \ = \ \frac{2 \ + \ 4 \ + \ 3}{3} \ = \ 3$$

$$Centroid_y \ = \ \frac{4 \ + \ 6 \ + \ 5}{3} \ = \ 5$$


So the centroid of all these data points is $(3,5)$

In higher dimensions(more number of variables),  the centroid is still just the **mean** of each coordinate (feature) across all points in the cluster and the centroid formula scales as follows :

$$Centroid_{feature} \ = \ \frac{sum \ of \ feature \ values}{number \ of \ points}$$

---

### **Why Is It Important?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ The centroid acts like the "**anchor**" for a cluster. 2Ô∏è‚É£ During the K-Means algorithm:

- Data points are assigned to the cluster whose centroid is **closest**.
- Centroids are recalculated based on the new points assigned.
- This process continues until centroids stop changing.

---
### **Important:**

- **The centroid might not be an actual data point**.
- It‚Äôs just the mathematical center, and sometimes no real data point is located there.
- In contrast, **K-Medoids** uses real data points as centers, not averages.

So, getting back to K-Means clustering,


### Algorithm of K-Means clustering

1. Choose the number of clusters `k`.
2. Randomly choose `k` centroids.
3. Assign each point to the **nearest centroid**. (This is done by calculating the distance of a point to all the centroids then assigning that point to the centroid with the lowest distance, thus creating a cluster)
4. Re-compute centroids as the **mean** of all points in the cluster (using the centroid formula).
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 until centroids don‚Äôt change (convergence is reached) or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

### Advantages of K-Means

Here are some advantages of the K-means clustering algorithm -

- **Scalability**¬†- ==K-means is a scalable algorithm that can handle large datasets with high dimensionality==. This is because it only requires calculating the distances between data points and their assigned cluster centroids.
- **Speed**¬†- ==K-means is a relatively fast algorithm, making it suitable for real-time or near-real-time applications==. It can handle datasets with millions of data points and converge to a solution in a few iterations.
- **Simplicity**¬†- K-means is a simple algorithm to implement and understand. It only requires specifying the number of clusters and the initial centroids, and it iteratively refines the clusters' centroids until convergence.
- **Interpretability**¬†- K-means provide interpretable results, as the clusters' centroids represent the centre points of the clusters. This makes it easy to interpret and understand the clustering results.

---
### Disadvantages of K-Means

Here are some disadvantages of the K-means clustering algorithm -

- **Curse of dimensionality**¬†- K-means is prone to the curse of dimensionality, which refers to the problem of high-dimensional data spaces. In high-dimensional spaces, the distance between any two data points becomes almost the same, making it difficult to differentiate between clusters.
- **User-defined K**¬†- K-means requires the user to specify the number of clusters (K) beforehand. This can be challenging if the user does not have prior knowledge of the data or if the optimal number of clusters is unknown.
- **Non-convex shape clusters**¬†- K-means assumes that the clusters are spherical, which means it cannot handle datasets with non-convex shape clusters. In such cases, other clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN, may be more suitable.
- **Unable to handle noisy data**¬†- K-means are sensitive to noisy data or outliers, which can significantly affect the clustering results. Preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection or noise reduction, may be required to address this issue.

---
## 2. K-Medoids Clustering

Similar to K-Means, but instead of using the **mean** as a center, it uses an **actual data point** (called a **medoid**) to represent the center.

Before, we proceed with that however,

### What is a Medoid?

A **medoid** is the **most centrally located actual data point** within a cluster.

Unlike a **centroid** (which is often an average, and not always a real data point) ‚Äî  
a **medoid** is always one of the **original, real points** from your dataset.


Imagine you have a group of houses on a map, and you want to choose a **meeting point** for a neighborhood gathering:

- **Centroid (K-Means)** would give you the average of all coordinates ‚Äî this could end up in the middle of a lake or someone‚Äôs rooftop!
- **Medoid (K-Medoids)** would pick one actual house from the group, the one that minimizes total travel distance for all neighbors.

---
### **How Is the Medoid Selected?**

1. For each data point in a cluster, calculate the **total distance** to all other points in the same cluster.
2. Choose the point with the **lowest total distance**.
3. That point becomes the **medoid** ‚Äî the most centrally located representative of the cluster.

---
### **Why Use Medoids?**

‚úÖ **Robust to Outliers:**  
Since medoids are real points, extreme outliers don‚Äôt "pull" the center like they do in K-Means.

‚úÖ **Flexible Distance Metrics:**  
You‚Äôre not limited to Euclidean distance ‚Äî you can use **Manhattan distance, cosine similarity, Hamming distance**, etc.

---
### Example 


Let‚Äôs say you have this simple dataset of 2D points:

| Point | X   | Y   |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| A     | 2   | 4   |
| B     | 4   | 6   |
| C     | 3   | 5   |
| D     | 9   | 9   |

In K-Means, the centroid would be "pulled" toward D because it's an **outlier**.

But in K-Medoids, the algorithm would likely select **B** or **C** as the medoid, since it‚Äôs an actual point and minimizes total distance to others.

Before we proceed further :

#### What is an Outlier?

An **outlier** is a data point that is **significantly different** or **far away** from the rest of the data.

It‚Äôs like that one kid in a class who‚Äôs either _way taller_ or _way shorter_ than everyone else ‚Äî they don‚Äôt fit the typical pattern of the group.

#### Example :

|Student|Age|
|---|---|
|A|21|
|B|22|
|C|21|
|D|20|
|E|54|

Here, **54** is clearly an outlier.  
It doesn‚Äôt match the pattern of the other students, who are all around 20‚Äì22 years old.

#### How Outliers Pull the Centroid

When you calculate a **centroid**, you are averaging all the points.  
If one point is way off (an outlier), it will **shift the average** toward itself.

#### Example :

Imagine all these points on a line

```python
[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 30]
```

If you compute the average, (centroid) :

$$Centroid \ = \ \frac{1 \ + \ 2 \ + \ 2 \ + \ 3 \ + \ 3 \ + \ 3 \ + \ 30}{7}$$


$$ = \frac{44}{7} \ \approx \ 6.29$$


Now, in comparison to what the value would be if we didn't have $30$

$$ Centroid \ = \ \frac{1 \ + \ 2 \ + \ 2 \ + \ 3 \ + \ 3 \ + \ 3}{6}  \ = \ \frac{14}{6} \ \approx \ 2.33$$



So, if we see the difference, just because of one outlier, the value of the centroid was much higher (pulled towards it).


However stuff like this doesn't happen with Medoids or K-Medoids since we select an actual data point.

### **General K-Medoids Process:**

1. **Initialization**  
    Randomly select `k` _medoids_ (real data points).
    
2. **Assignment Step**  
    Assign each data point to the nearest medoid based on Euclidean (or another) distance.
    
3. **Update Step**  
    For each cluster:
    
    - Test each point in the cluster.
    - Calculate the total distance from that point to all other points in the cluster.
    - Choose the point with the lowest total distance as the **new medoid**.

4. **Convergence Check**  
    Repeat steps 2 and 3 until:
    
    - The medoids no longer change.
    - Or a max number of iterations is reached.

---
### Code

Here's a python program if needed, to understand K-Medoids better

```python
# K-Medoids

  

'''

Algorithm

  

1. Initialization

¬† ¬† Randomly select `k` _medoids (real data points).

2. Assignment Step

¬† ¬† Assign each data point to the nearest medoid based on Euclidean (or another) distance.

3. Update Step

¬† ¬† For each cluster:

¬† ¬† - Test each point in the cluster.

¬† ¬† - Calculate the total distance from that point to all other points in the cluster.

¬† ¬† - Choose the point with the lowest total distance as the **new medoid**.

4. Convergence Check

¬† ¬† Repeat steps 2 and 3 until:

¬† ¬† - The medoids no longer change.

¬† ¬† - Or a max number of iterations is reached.

  

We use medoids because unlike centroids, which are often pulled towards outliers (the farthest data point), this doesn't happen with medoids, which is an actual data point within the dataset

# Hierarchical Clustering Methods

Hierarchical clustering builds a **tree-like structure** called a **dendrogram** to represent nested groupings of data points based on similarity.

Unlike K-Means or K-Medoids, you **don‚Äôt need to predefine the number of clusters** ‚Äî the algorithm shows how the data groups together at all levels.

## Two Types of Hierarchical Clustering Methods are

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up Approach)**

This is the most common method.

- **Start:** Each data point is its own cluster.
- **Step-by-Step:**
    - Find the two **closest clusters** and merge them.
    - Repeat until all points belong to one single cluster.
- **Result:** A nested hierarchy of clusters, visualized as a **dendrogram**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Divisive (Top-Down Approach)**

Less common but useful for specific cases.

- **Start:** All data points are in **one big cluster**.
- **Step-by-Step:**
    - Split the cluster into smaller and smaller groups.
    - Keep dividing until every point is its own cluster.
- **Result:** Also visualized as a dendrogram, but built top-down.

---
## How Do You Decide Which Clusters to Merge or Split?

This depends on **distance measurement** and **linkage criteria**.

###  **Distance Measures** (how you measure similarity):

- **Euclidean distance** (straight-line distance)
- **Manhattan distance** (grid-like path)
- **Cosine similarity** (angle-based)

---

### **Linkage Criteria** (how you choose which clusters to merge):

| Method               | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Single Linkage**   | Minimum distance between two points from different clusters. |
| **Complete Linkage** | Maximum distance between two points from different clusters. |
| **Average Linkage**  | Average distance between all pairs from two clusters.        |
| **Ward‚Äôs Method**    | Minimizes the total variance within clusters.                |

---
## Dendrogram Example:

A **dendrogram** looks like an upside-down tree.

- The **height of the branches** represents the distance between merged clusters.
- You can **"cut" the dendrogram** at any height to choose the number of clusters.

---

## Real-World Use Cases:

- **Biology:** Classifying species based on genetic similarity.
- **Document Grouping:** Grouping similar research papers.
- **Customer Segmentation:** When you don‚Äôt know how many types of customers exist in advance.

---
## Summary Table:

| Feature      | Agglomerative                | Divisive                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Start With   | Each data point as a cluster | All data points in one cluster |
| Process      | Merge closest pairs          | Split into smaller groups      |
| End With     | One cluster                  | N clusters of single points    |
| Common Usage | Very common                  | Less common                    |

---
# Agglomerative Approach -- Bottom Up Approach

This is the **most popular** form of hierarchical clustering.  

### Algorithm

0. Firstly convert the data points to their own clusters, each point is treated as a cluster itself, so the dataset now becomes a "cluster of clusters"
1. Select a `k` value.
2. Choose a linkage type (the linkage method is used to choose which clusters to merge)
3. Take two clusters at a time from the list of clusters, use the linkage method to find two clusters which are closest to each other and then merge them into a single cluster.
4. After merging, recalculate the distance between this newly formed cluster and the remaining clusters, merging more clusters based on their distances.
5. Repeat this entire process till the total length of the "cluster of clusters" becomes less than the chosen `k`

Example :

Input data set:

```python
data_points = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (5, 5), (8, 8), (9, 9)]
```

Output, with different `k`-values and different linkage types

```python
Using single linkage with k=2

[[(1, 1), (2, 2), (5, 5)], [(8, 8), (9, 9)]] ¬† ¬†

Using complete linkage with k=3

[[(1, 1), (2, 2)], [(5, 5)], [(8, 8), (9, 9)]] ¬†

Using average linkage with k=4

[[(1, 1), (2, 2)], [(5, 5)], [(8, 8)], [(9, 9)]]
```

Note how the point `(5,5)` is considered close to the initial cluster `[(1,1), (2,2)]`  with single linkage and `k=2`

How it becomes it's own cluster as a "mid-point cluster" at `k=3` and complete linkage

And how it's considered too far from the first cluster,  but considered close enough to the point `(8,8)` so it's clustered in with the 4'th point `(8,8)` at `k=4` and average linkage


Why does this happen?

|Linkage Type|Behavior with bridge points like (5,5)|
|---|---|
|üîó **Single Linkage**|Looks for the **closest pair**. (5,5) gets attached early to whichever cluster has a point nearest to it ‚Äî even if the rest of the cluster is far away.|
|üîí **Complete Linkage**|Looks for the **farthest pair** inside a merged cluster. If (5,5) would make the merged cluster's max distance too large, it avoids merging.|
|‚öñÔ∏è **Average Linkage**|Looks for the **average distance** to all points. If the cluster's center drifts too far from (5,5), it will hold off merging, even if one neighbor is close.|

### And when `k` is set lower:

You‚Äôre **forcing more compression**, so borderline points like (5,5) get "absorbed" sooner ‚Äî even if they might not be a perfect fit ‚Äî just to reduce the cluster count.  
When `k` is higher, there‚Äôs more **freedom to hold off merging**, so these points remain on their own longer.


Lastly, (optional):

 **Build a Dendrogram**:  
    The process is visualized as a **dendrogram** ‚Äî an inverted tree that shows the merging order and distances.

This is how it would be visualized as a dendrogram (for average linking)

- Easy to visualize with a dendrogram.
- Works well even when clusters are of different shapes and sizes.

- Computationally expensive (**O(n¬≤)** or worse).
- Sensitive to **noisy data** and **outliers**.
- Once a decision is made to merge two clusters, it cannot be undone.

---
# Divisive Hierarchical Clustering -- Top Down Approach

### **Process Step-By-Step:**

We choose a `k` value.

We have a single cluster of all points. 

For example: 

```python
[(1,1), (2,2), (5,5), (8,8), (9,9)]
```

and `k=3`


We compute the distances of all points to each other. 

For example as I did in my code :

```python
while len(new_super_cluster) + 1 < self.k: ¬†# +1 because cluster still holds one group

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† distances_dict = {}

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Step 1: Compute pairwise distances

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† for i in range(len(cluster)):

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† for j in range(i + 1, len(cluster)):

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† distance = self.euclidean_distance(cluster[i], cluster[j])

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† distances_dict[(cluster[i], cluster[j])] = distance

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if not distances_dict:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† break ¬†# nothing to split
```


We pick the two farthest points first and assign them to two separate clusters. 

```python
new_cluster1 = [(1,1)]
new_cluster2 = [(9,9)]
```

We remove these two points from the original cluster to remove confusion 

Now we compute the distances of the remaining points to these two new clusters.

Now check each of the remaining points: `(2,2)`, `(5,5)`, `(8,8)`.

- `(2,2)` is closer to `(1,1)` ‚Üí goes to `new_cluster1`.
- `(5,5)` is exactly in the middle but you can assign it to either (say `new_cluster1`).
- `(8,8)` is closer to `(9,9)` ‚Üí goes to `new_cluster2`.


Whichever point is closer to whichever cluster is assigned to that cluster.

Now we consider the cluster with the lesser number of elements as "done" and assign it to our final cluster list 

If we want `k=3` clusters, we still need to split further.  
Usually the smaller cluster is considered ‚Äúdone.‚Äù

- `new_cluster2` has fewer points: `[(9,9), (8,8)]`.  
So it is added to a `new_super_cluster`.

```python
new_super_cluster = [[(9,9), (8,8)]]
cluster = [(1,1), (2,2), (5,5)] # remaining cluster which we need to work on further
```

Then we continue the process with the remaining cluster, pick farthest points, assign to two new clusters, remove them from the current cluster, compute distances to the remaining points in the cluster and then assign the one with the lesser number of elements to our final cluster list. 

- `cluster = [(1,1), (2,2), (5,5)]`.

Farthest pair is `(1,1)` and `(5,5)`.

Assign the remaining point `(2,2)`:

- Distance to `(1,1)` is smaller ‚Üí goes to `new_cluster1`.

```python
new_cluster1 = [(1,1), (2,2)]
new_cluster2 = [(5,5)]
```
`new_cluster2` has only 1 point, so it's smaller ‚Üí  
move `[(5,5)]` to `new_super_cluster`.

```python
new_super_cluster = [[(9,9), (8,8)], [(5,5)]]
cluster = [(1,1), (2,2)]
```

- `cluster = [(1,1), (2,2)]`.

Farthest pair: `(1,1)` and `(2,2)`.

Since these are the only two, they each become their own cluster.


And this process keeps on repeating till our original cluster's length becomes = our chosen k value since our condition is to keep running while the length of the cluster is greater than the chosen k, so the whole thing stops when our cluster length equals our chosen k.


So we get our final cluster as :

```python
new_super_cluster = [[(9,9), (8,8)], [(5,5)], [(1,1)], [(2,2)]]
```

**Outputs for different k-values**

```python
[[(1, 1), (2, 2)], [(5, 5), (8, 8), (9, 9)]] for k value: 2  
[[(1, 1), (2, 2)], [(5, 5)], [(8, 8), (9, 9)]] for k value: 3
[[(1, 1), (2, 2)], [(5, 5)], [(9, 9)], [(8, 8)]] for k value: 4
```


5. **Build Dendrogram**:  
    Like AHC, a dendrogram is formed ‚Äî but this time it starts at the top and splits down.

### Code

Here's a python program if needed to better understand divisive clustering

```python
from typing import List

from math import sqrt

  
  

data_points = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (5, 5), (8, 8), (9, 9)] # Our data set

  

class DivisiveClustering():

¬† ¬† def __init__(self, points: list[tuple[int|float]], k: int):

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self.points = points

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† self.k = k

  

¬† ¬† def euclidean_distance(self, c1: tuple, c2: tuple) -> int|float:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return sqrt((c2[0]-c1[0])**2 ¬†+ (c2[1] - c1[1])**2) ¬†# root-over((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2) ¬† ¬†

  
  

¬† ¬† def divisive_clustering(self) -> List:

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† cluster = self.points.copy() ¬†# start with all points as one cluster

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_super_cluster = []

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† while len(new_super_cluster) + 1 < self.k: ¬†# +1 because cluster still holds one group

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† distances_dict = {}

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Step 1: Compute pairwise distances

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† for i in range(len(cluster)):

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† for j in range(i + 1, len(cluster)):

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† distance = self.euclidean_distance(cluster[i], cluster[j])

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† distances_dict[(cluster[i], cluster[j])] = distance

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if not distances_dict:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† break ¬†# nothing to split

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Step 2: Pick the two farthest points

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† highest_distance = max(distances_dict.values())

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† farthest_pair = [key for key, val in distances_dict.items() if val == highest_distance][0]

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† point1, point2 = farthest_pair

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Step 3: Assign points to the closest of the two

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_cluster1 = []

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_cluster2 = []

  
  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† for point in cluster:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† dist_to_1 = self.euclidean_distance(point, point1)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† dist_to_2 = self.euclidean_distance(point, point2)

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if dist_to_1 < dist_to_2:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_cluster1.append(point)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† else:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_cluster2.append(point)

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Step 4: Choose one cluster to hold for future splits, the other goes to final list

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Let's push the smaller one to the final list

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† if len(new_cluster1) < len(new_cluster2):

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_super_cluster.append(new_cluster1)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† cluster = new_cluster2

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† else:

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_super_cluster.append(new_cluster2)

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† cluster = new_cluster1

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† # Add the last remaining cluster

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† new_super_cluster.append(cluster)

  

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† return new_super_cluster

  
  

for k in [2, 3, 4]:

¬† ¬† div_cluster = DivisiveClustering(data_points, k)

¬† ¬† print(div_cluster.divisive_clustering(), f"for k value: {k}")
```

### Strengths:

- Can be **more accurate** if the initial cluster is well-formed.
- Better for datasets where the global structure is more important than local relationships.

---
### Weaknesses:

- **Less common** in practical use.
- Requires defining a clear **splitting strategy**, which can be subjective.
- Sensitive to the **first split** ‚Äî a bad early split can ruin the final cluster arrangement.

# Classification and Prediction : Decision Trees

### **What are Decision Trees?**

They are tree-structured models used for:

- **Classification** (categorizing data),
- **Regression** (predicting numeric values),
- **Rule Extraction** (interpretable decision-making).

A decision tree splits data into branches based on feature values, asking questions at each node until it reaches a final decision at a leaf node.

So far all the algorithms we did, we have just done **classification**. Regression is something we haven't done yet.

---
### **Where are Decision Trees Used in Data Mining?**

|Application Area|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Classification**|Predict categorical labels|Spam detection, disease diagnosis|
|**Regression**|Predict numerical values|Predict house prices, stock prices|
|**Rule Mining / Knowledge Discovery**|Extract human-readable patterns|Customer churn reasoning, fraud detection|
|**Feature Selection**|Identify most informative features|Preprocessing step in AI pipelines|
|**Handling Missing Data**|Splitting based on available info|Medical datasets, survey data|
|**Ensemble Methods**|Boosting or bagging models|Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees|

### **Common Decision Tree Algorithms in Data Mining**

| Algorithm         | Specialty                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ID3**           | Uses entropy and information gain for splitting.                   |
| **C4.5**          | Successor to ID3, handles continuous values, missing data.         |
| **CART**          | Classification and Regression Trees. Supports binary splits.       |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy and generalization. |

### **Example: Simple Decision Tree Use Case**

Imagine this dataset:

|Weather|Temperature|Play?|
|---|---|---|
|Sunny|Hot|No|
|Sunny|Cool|Yes|
|Overcast|Hot|Yes|
|Rainy|Cool|Yes|

A decision tree might split like:

```python
Is Weather == Sunny?
 ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Is Temperature == Hot?
 ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Play: No
 ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ No  ‚Üí Play: Yes
 ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Play: Yes

# 1. ID3 Algorithm (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvveVcbHynE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWzpomtLqqs (ID3)

**Invented by:** Ross Quinlan (1986)  
**Use:** Primarily for _classification_.  
**Goal:** Build a decision tree by choosing attributes that give the most information gain at each split.

---
## **How it Works**

Let's say we have this dataset:

|Outlook|Temperature|Humidity|Wind|Play Tennis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Sunny|Hot|High|Weak|No|
|Sunny|Hot|High|Strong|No|
|Overcast|Hot|High|Weak|Yes|
|Rain|Mild|High|Weak|Yes|
|Rain|Cool|Normal|Weak|Yes|
|Rain|Cool|Normal|Strong|No|
|Overcast|Cool|Normal|Strong|Yes|
|Sunny|Mild|High|Weak|No|
|Sunny|Cool|Normal|Weak|Yes|
|Rain|Mild|Normal|Weak|Yes|
|Sunny|Mild|Normal|Strong|Yes|
|Overcast|Mild|High|Strong|Yes|
|Overcast|Hot|Normal|Weak|Yes|
|Rain|Mild|High|Strong|No|

### Step 1.  **Entropy Calculation**  

Entropy measures the disorder or impurity in your data.

This is the entropy calculation for the entire dataset

For a set $S$ with positive and negative examples:

$$Entropy(S) \ = \ -p_+ \ log_2(p_+) \ - \ p_{-} \ log_2(p_-)$$


or 

$$Entropy(S) \ = \ - \frac{Yes}{Total} \ log(\frac{Yes}{Total}) \ - \ \frac{No}{Total} \ log(\frac{No}{Total})$$

Where:

- $p_+$‚Äã = probability of "Yes"
- $p_-$‚Äã = probability of "No"

Here, in total:

- 9 Yes
- 5 No

in the column of  "Play Tennisi"

So, 

$$Entropy(S) \ = \ - (\frac{9}{14})log_2(\frac{9}{14}) \ - \ (\frac{5}{14})log_2(\frac{5}{14})$$


$$Entropy(S) \ \approx \ -0.0643 \ \times log_2 \ (0.0643) \ - \ 0.357 \ \times log_2 \ (0.357)$$

$$Entropy(S) \ \approx \ 0.940$$

---
### Step 2: Calculate **Information Gain** for Each Attribute

#### For **Outlook**:

| Outlook  | Temperature | Humidity | Wind   | Play Tennis |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | Weak   | No          |
| Sunny    | Hot         | High     | Strong | No          |
| Overcast | Hot         | High     | Weak   | Yes         |
| Rain     | Mild        | High     | Weak   | Yes         |
| Rain     | Cool        | Normal   | Weak   | Yes         |
| Rain     | Cool        | Normal   | Strong | No          |
| Overcast | Cool        | Normal   | Strong | Yes         |
| Sunny    | Mild        | High     | Weak   | No          |
| Sunny    | Cool        | Normal   | Weak   | Yes         |
| Rain     | Mild        | Normal   | Weak   | Yes         |
| Sunny    | Mild        | Normal   | Strong | Yes         |
| Overcast | Mild        | High     | Strong | Yes         |
| Overcast | Hot         | Normal   | Weak   | Yes         |
| Rain     | Mild        | High     | Strong | No          |


Outlook has three values: Sunny, Overcast, Rain.

- Sunny: 5 samples ‚Üí 2 Yes, 3 No.
- Overcast: 4 samples ‚Üí 4 Yes.
- Rain: 5 samples ‚Üí 3 Yes, 2 No.

Entropy for each:

$$Entropy(Sunny) \ = \ -\frac{2}{5} \ \log_2(\frac{2}{5}) \ - \ \frac{3}{5} \ \log_2(\frac{3}{5})$$


$$Entropy(Sunny) \ = \ -\ 0.4 \times -1.32 \ - \ 0.6 \times -0.73 $$


$$Entropy(Sunny) \ \approx \ 0.528 \ + \ 0.438 \ \approx \ 0.966$$



$$Entropy(Overcast) \ = \ -\frac{4}{4} \ log_2(\frac{4}{4}) \ - \ 0$$

$$Entropy(Overcast) \ \approx \ -1 \ \times \ 0 \ \approx \ 0$$

Similarly :

$$Entropy(Rain) \ \approx \ -\frac{3}{5} \ \log_2(\frac{3}{5}) \ - \ \frac{2}{5} \ \log_2(\frac{2}{5})$$

$$Entropy(Rain) \ = \ -0.6 \ \times -0.73 \ - \ 0.4 \ \times -1.32$$

$$Entropy(Rain) \ \approx \ 0.966$$


Now, weighted entropy for outlook :

$$Entropy(Outlook) \ = \ \Sigma (\frac{Total \ number \ of \ samples \ per \ part}{Total \ number \ o f \ entries \ in \ table}) \ $$


So :

$$Entropy(Outlook) \ = \ \frac{5}{14}(0.966) \ + \ 0 \ + \frac{5}{14}(0.966)$$

$$Entropy(Outlook) \ \approx \ 0.345 \ + \ 0.345 \ = \ 0.69$$


Now, Information Gain of Outlook :

$$Gain(Outlook) \ = \ Entropy(Dataset) \ - \ Entropy(Outlook)$$


$$Gain(Outlook) \ \approx 0.940 \ - \ 0.69 \ \approx \ 0.25$$
---
#### For Temperature

- Hot $\rightarrow$  4 samples $\rightarrow$  2 yes, 2 no
- Mild $\rightarrow$ 6 samples $\rightarrow$  4 yes, 2 no
- Cool $\rightarrow$ 4 samples $\rightarrow$ 3 yes, 1 no

Since all the calculation by hand is quite time consuming, I will just write out the rest here :

$$Entropy(Hot) \ = \ 1.0$$

$$Entropy(Mild) \ = \ 0.918$$

$$Entropy(Cool) \ = \ 0.811$$


$$Entropy(Temperature) \ = \ 0.911$$

$$Gain(Temperature) \ = \ 0.029$$
---
#### For Humidity

- High:  7 samples , 3 yes, 4 no
- Normal: 7 samples, 6 yes, 1 no

$$Entropy(High) \ = \ 0.985$$

$$Entropy(Normal) \ = \ 0.592$$

$$Entropy(Humidity) \ = \ 0.788$$

$$Gain(Humidity) \ = \ 0.151$$

---
#### For Wind

- Weak : 8 samples, 6 yes, 2 no
- Strong: 6 samples, 3 yes, 3 no


$$Entropy(Weak) \ = \ 0.811$$

$$Entropy(Strong) \ = \ 1.0$$


$$Entropy(Wind) \ = \ 0.892$$

$$Gain(Wind) \ = \ 0.048$$

---
## Creating the Decision Tree

‚úÖ **General Workflow for ID3:**

1. **At the start:** all attributes are candidates.
2. At each split, after choosing an attribute, it is **removed from consideration for that path**.
3. The remaining attributes are checked for Information Gain at each node until:
    - Entropy is zero (pure class) (will be considered a Leaf Node)
    - Attributes are exhausted (stop condition).


Now that we have all the data :

|Attribute|Information Gain|
|---|---|
|Outlook|**0.247** (Highest)|
|Humidity|0.151|
|Wind|0.048|
|Temperature|0.029|

We choose the root node with the highest information gain, in this case, outlook

```python
            [ Outlook ]
           /     |     \
      Sunny  Overcast  Rain
```

Now for the Overcast Branch

Now we need to decide which node is a leaf node and which nodes will be continued.

We have the entropies of the three :

$$Entropy(Overcast) \ = \ 0$$


$$Entropy(Sunny) \ = \ 0.966$$


$$Entropy(Rain) \ = \ 0.966$$


So Overcast is a leaf node.

Now, we will expand the remaining nodes

Sunny and Rain.

Before that, a quick note:

**At every split, the dataset is reduced to a subset containing only the records that match the conditions so far. Information Gain is recalculated within this subset to decide the next best split.**

Keeping that in mind,

For Sunny

We have the current subset as :

|Outlook|Temperature|Humidity|Wind|PlayTennis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Sunny|Hot|High|Weak|No|
|Sunny|Hot|High|Strong|No|
|Sunny|Mild|High|Weak|No|
|Sunny|Cool|Normal|Weak|Yes|
|Sunny|Mild|Normal|Strong|Yes|

So the highest gain in this table goes to Humidity.

Now for `Outlook = Sunny`  and `Humidity = High`, we have `PlayTennis = No`  and `For Humidity = Normal`, we have `PlayTennis = Yes`


These are **pure splits**, i.e the data is splitting into two outcomes purely.

```python
                  [ Outlook ]
               /      |        \
          Sunny    Overcast    Rain
         /             |       
Humidity              Yes    
  /    |                          
High   Normal           
|      |               
No     Yes
```

So this becomes the current tree.


Similarly now for Rain, the subset becomes :

| Outlook | Temperature | Humidity | Wind   | PlayTennis |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Rain    | Mild        | High     | Weak   | Yes        |
| Rain    | Cool        | Normal   | Weak   | Yes        |
| Rain    | Cool        | Normal   | Strong | No         |
| Rain    | Mild        | Normal   | Weak   | Yes        |
| Rain    | Mild        | High     | Strong | No         |



Now since we already split on Humidity before, the remaining unused attributes are Temperature and Wind, and since the next highest gain is on Wind:

So after Rain, we split on Wind

So the final decision tree becomes now :

```python
                 [ Outlook ]
               /      |        \
          Sunny    Overcast    Rain
         /             |         |
Humidity              Yes       Wind
  /    |                         |  \
High   Normal                  Weak  Strong
 /     |                        |      \
No     Yes                     Yes      No
```

We stop the tree here since all attributes have been exhausted (Yes and No are the final outcomes so they are most certainly, leaf nodes).

# CART (Classification and Regression Trees)

- **Full form:** Classification And Regression Trees
- Unlike ID3 (which only does classification), **CART** can handle:
    - **Classification** (Yes/No, Class A/B/C).
    - **Regression** (predicting continuous values like price, temperature, etc.).

## Difference between CART and ID3

| Feature          | ID3                            | CART                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Splitting Metric | Information Gain (Entropy)     | Gini Index                             |
| Output           | Only Classification            | Classification + Regression            |
| Tree Structure   | Multiway splits possible       | Always Binary Splits (2 branches only) |
| Pruning          | Post-pruning sometimes applied | Typically uses cost-complexity pruning |

---
## Gini Index

In CART, the "purity" of a node is measured using **Gini Impurity**, not entropy.

The formula for Gini for a dataset $D$ is:

$$ Gini(D)=1‚àí‚àë^{n}_{i=1} \ ‚Äãp^2_i‚Äã$$


or :

$$Gini(D) \ = \ 1 \ - \ (\frac{Yes}{Total})^2 \ - \ (\frac{No}{Total})^2$$


Where:

- $p_i$ is the probability of picking class $i$ at random.
- Lower Gini = purer set.

---
### ‚ö° **CART Algorithm Steps:**

1. **For every attribute**, and for every possible split point (yes, even numerical ones), compute the **Gini Index** of the split.
    
2. Choose the **split** (attribute + threshold) that gives the **lowest Gini impurity** in the two resulting nodes.
    
3. Repeat this process **recursively** for the child nodes.
    
4. Stop when:
    
    - All records belong to the same class.
    - There are no more attributes.
    - The Gini index reaches 0.
        
5. Optionally: **prune the tree** to avoid overfitting.

---
## Example

Let's work with a simplified dataset this time to save some time for us.

|Weather|PlayTennis|
|---|---|
|Sunny|No|
|Overcast|Yes|
|Rainy|Yes|
|Sunny|No|
|Sunny|Yes|

1. For each attribute, compute the Gini impurity for possible splits.
2. Choose the split that gives **maximum reduction in impurity**.
3. Make **binary splits only** (unlike ID3 which might split multiway).

### **Why Binary Splits?**

- Simplifies pruning.
- More predictable and balanced trees.
- Easier handling of numerical attributes (like age, income).

---
So let's start off by calculating the Gini Indexes of each attribute

Firstly, Gini Index of the entire table (Parent Node)

Total samples = 5

- Yes = 2
- No = 3

So,

$$Gini_{Parent} \ = \ 1 \ - \ (\frac{2}{5})^2 \ - \ (\frac{3}{5})^2$$


$$Gini_{Parent} \ = \ 1 \ - \ 0.16 \ - \ 0.36 \ = \ 0.48$$


Now, Gini Index of the Weather attribute

Weather has 3 subcategories:

- Sunny : 3 samples $\rightarrow$  2 No, 1 Yes
- Overcast: 1 sample $\rightarrow$ Yes
- Rainy: 1 sample $\rightarrow$ Yes


So, 

$$Gini_{Sunny} \ = \ 1 \ - \ (\frac{1}{3})^2 \ - \ (\frac{2}{3})^2$$

$$Gini_{Sunny} \ = \ 1 \ - \ 0.111 \ - \ 0.444 \ = \ 0.444$$


$$Gini_{Overcast} \ = \ 1 \ - \ 1^2 \ = \ 0$$

$$Gini_{Rainy} \ = \ 1 \ - \ 1^2 \ = \ 0$$

Now, we need to calculate the weighted Gini index for the Weather attribute :

That's just :

$$Gini_{Weather} \ = \ \frac{Total \ samples \ of \ Sunny}{Total \ overall \ samples } \ \times Gini_{Sunny} \ + \ \frac{Total \ samples \ of \ Overcast}{Total \ samples} \ \times Gini_{Overcast} \ $$

$$+ \ \frac{Total \ samples \ of \ Rain}{Total \ Samples} \ \times Gini_{Rainy}$$


So, $$Gini_{Weather} \ = \ (\frac{3}{5} \ \times \ 0.444) \ + \ (\frac{1}{5} \ \times 0) \ + (\frac{1}{5} \ \times 0)$$


$$Gini_{Weather} \ = \ 0.2664$$




Well since there are no more attributes in the table, let's proceed with creating the decision tree.

The tree will be split on Weather as it's the only attribute here

```python
          [Weather]
         /    |     \
    Sunny  Overcast  Rainy
```


Now, for overcast and rainy  both subsets have only one samples

| Weather  | PlayTennis |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Overcast | Yes        |
| Rainy    | Yes        |

So both will have leaf nodes 

```python
          [Weather]
         /    |     \
    Sunny  Overcast  Rainy
      /       |        \
             Yes      Yes 
```


As for the remaining node of Sunny,

|Weather|PlayTennis|
|---|---|
|Sunny|No|
|Sunny|No|
|Sunny|Yes|

This seems to be an impure split since the number of leaf nodes are not equally split.

In a traditional example we would have more attributes and more Gini Gains to decide for a split.

However since Weather is the only attribute present in the table, despite the rule of not using a used attribute again, we have no choice but to use Weather again for split.

As for what the leaf node will be, we do a majority voting and see that the value of No appears more than the value of Yes.

So the leaf node for Sunny will be No.

So we have our final decision tree as:

```python
          [Weather]
         /    |     \
    Sunny  Overcast  Rainy
      /       |        \
    No       Yes      Yes 
```

**Note**: In a real world example we would proceed with the calculation of the Gini Gains of all the attributes and then proceed like in the proceed of ID3, that is choosing the max Gini gain, using the corresponding attribute for a split in the tree, and then using the next unused attribute which has the highest gain among the remaining, just like how we did in ID3.

Since this example for learning purposes only, I saved the time taken by calculations by using a minimal dataset, something we would not see in most examples.

## Example practice for CART

However for a sample practice example we can use this dataset

![Pasted image 20250422115140.png](/img/user/media/Pasted%20image%2020250422115140.png)


So we have the table as :

| GPA    | Studied | Passed |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| Low    | F       | F      |
| Low    | T       | T      |
| Medium | F       | F      |
| Medium | T       | T      |
| High   | F       | T      |
| High   | T       | T      |

### 1. Gini index for the entire dataset

Total : 6
F: 2
T : 4

$$Gini(D) \ = \ 1 \ - \ \frac{4}{9} \ - \ \frac{1}{9}$$


$$Gini(D) \ = \ 1 \ - \ \frac{5}{9} \ = \ 1 \ - \ 0.555$$

$$Gini(D) \ \approx \ 0.445$$

---
### 2. Gini Index for Studied attribute

Total samples of Studied = 6. Split between `T` and `F`

`Studied = T`

|GPA|Studied|Passed|
|---|---|---|
|Low|T|T|
|Medium|T|T|
|High|T|T|

Total: 3
T: 3
F: 0

$$Gini(Studied_T) \ = \ 1 \ - \ \frac{3}{3} \ - \ 0$$


$$Gini(Studied_T) \ = \ 0$$


`Studied = F`

|GPA|Studied|Passed|
|---|---|---|
|Low|F|F|
|Medium|F|F|
|High|F|T|

Total: 3
T: 1
F: 2

$$Gini(Studied_F) \ = \ 1 \ - \ \frac{1}{9} \ - \ \frac{4}{9}$$


$$Gini(Studied_F) \ = \ 0.445$$

Weighted Gini:

$$Gini(Studied) \ = \ (\frac{3}{6} \ \times \ 0) \ + \ (\frac{3}{6} \ \times \ 0.445)$$

$$Gini(Studied) \ = \ 0 \ + \ 0.2225$$


$$Gini(Studied) \ \approx \ 0.2225$$

---
### 3. Gini Index for GPA attribute

Now GPA has 3 values, we will split the dataset 3 times based on the values

Total GPA samples : 6
#### GPA = Low:

|Studied|Passed|
|---|---|
|F|F|
|T|T|

1 `F`, 1 `T`  

$$Gini(GPA_{Low}) \ = \ 1 \ - \ \frac{1}{4} \ - \ \frac{1}{4}$$


$$Gini(GPA_{Low}) \ = \ 1 \ - \ \frac{1}{2}$$


$$Gini(GPA_{Low}) \ = \ 0.5$$



#### GPA = Medium:

|Studied|Passed|
|---|---|
|F|F|
|T|T|
1 `F`, 1 `T`

Same:  
Gini = 0.5



#### GPA = High:

|Studied|Passed|
|---|---|
|F|T|
|T|T|

Both `T`:  Gini = 0


Weighted Gini: 

$$Gini(GPA) \ = \ (\frac{2}{6} \ \times \ 0.5) \ + \ (\frac{2}{6} \ \times \ 0.5) \ + \ 0$$

$$Gini(GPA) \ \approx \ 0.3333$$

---
### Choosing the best split

We have so far:

- `Studied`: Gini = 0.2222
- `GPA`: Gini = 0.3333

Unlike what we do in ID3, where we choose the attribute with the highest information gain, in CART, we choose the attribute with the lowest Gini Index

So we will split on `Studied`

| GPA    | Studied | Passed |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| Low    | F       | F      |
| Low    | T       | T      |
| Medium | F       | F      |
| Medium | T       | T      |
| High   | F       | T      |
| High   | T       | T      |

Since the `T` branch on `Studied` has the same output `T`, so it will become a leaf node (it's Gini was 0 as well)

However the `F` branch on `Studied`  has two branching outputs 2 `F` and 1 `T`

So on the `F` branch of `Studied` we will split further on the next available attribute with the lowest Gini, that is, `GPA`.

Now for `GPA`

`Low` branch has the outputs : `F = F` and `T = T`, meaning not passed for Low GPA if the student didn't study, but passed for Low GPA is the student studied.

`Medium` branch has the same output.

`High` branch has the output `T` regardless of what `Studied` has, meaning the student will most definitely pass if they have a high GPA

So our tree will become
```python
[Studied?]
 ‚îú‚îÄ T: Passed = T
 ‚îî‚îÄ F:        
       ‚îî‚îÄ   GPA
          /  |   \
       Low Medium High
       /     |     /  \
     F|T    F|T   T    T
   (Tie)   (Tie) (Pure)(Pure)

```  
Now we have a problem.

Both the Low and Medium branches of GPA have the same Gini Index as well, that creates a problem that we can't decide the split using the traditional way of deciding the minimum Gini Index.

So we need a **tie-breaker**.

Generally, other algorithms have tie-breakers in them such as **random-picking**, or **alphabetical sorting** or **first occurrence**.

In our case, to keep things simple we will use **alphabetical sorting**.

So if we sort `F` and `T` alphabetically, so the outputs for `Low` and `Medium` branches of `GPA` would be `F`.

This also makes sense if we think logically, that if a student did not study, and scored a Low GPA, they would most certainly not pass, and a Medium GPA generally gives a 50/50 chance of passing, hence our Gini Index of 0.5, but for tie-breaking purposes our decision tree will consider that as a `F`.

So our final decision tree becomes:

```python
[Studied?]
 ‚îú‚îÄ T: Passed = T
 ‚îî‚îÄ F:        
       ‚îî‚îÄ   GPA
          /  |   \
       Low Medium High
       /     |     /  \
     F       F    T    T
                (Pure)(Pure)
```

However this way of tie-breaking kind of ignores nuances, like there is a certain possibility of a person passing with a medium GPA if they didn't study. What about that? Or even in extreme cases, passing with a low GPA?

Well usually in such cases more better algorithms like `random forest` are used to grow multiple trees and use a **majority voting** metric to solve out the nuances or sometimes we can just modify the tree to return probabilities instead of hard values like:

| GPA    | Passed Probability      |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| Low    | 40% Passed / 60% Failed |
| Medium | 50% Passed / 50% Failed |
| High   | 90% Passed / 10% Failed |

This type of outputs can help a bit in dealing with such nuances.

# Prediction (or Regression) using Clustering Algorithms

Before we proceed to pattern mining, let's take a step back and try to do some "prediction" or **regression** based on all the algorithms we studied so far.

**Regression in Clustering-Based Models**

==Regression is the task of predicting a continuous value for a given input. In the context of clustering, regression can be approached by first grouping data points into clusters based on similarity, and then predicting a value for a new input based on the properties of the cluster it belongs to==. This is a hybrid method that blends unsupervised learning (clustering) with supervised prediction (regression).

The common principle used in clustering-based regression is:

- Group similar data points into clusters.
- Assign a target value to each cluster, often as the average (mean) or representative value (like medoid) of the data points in that cluster.
- When a new data point is given, find the cluster it would most likely belong to.
- Predict the target value based on the cluster's assigned value.

---

### Algorithms We Used for Clustering-Based Regression

#### 1. **Agglomerative Clustering Regression**

Agglomerative clustering is a bottom-up approach where each data point starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.

- **Single Linkage**: Merges clusters based on the minimum distance between their points.
- **Complete Linkage**: Uses the maximum distance between points in two clusters.
- **Average Linkage**: Uses the average pairwise distance between points in the two clusters.

**How it handles regression**:

- After clustering, each cluster's target is computed as the average of the values in that cluster.
- To predict a value for a new point, the algorithm finds the closest cluster based on the specified linkage rule.

**Effect of changing k-values**:

- More clusters (higher _k_) leads to finer groupings and more specific predictions.
- With smaller _k_, predictions are more general, potentially averaging over more diverse data.

**Effect of linkage**:

- Different linkage methods create different clustering structures.
- This leads to different predictions for the same input because the structure of the clusters and their centroids/medoids differ.

##### Example output

```python
Using single linkage with k=2
Cluster:  [[((1, 1), 10), ((2, 2), 20), ((5, 5), 15)], [((8, 8), 25), ((9, 9), 30)]]    
Cluster targets:  {0: 15.0, 1: 27.5}
Prediction for (5, 10): 27.5


Using complete linkage with k=3
Cluster:  [[((1, 1), 10), ((2, 2), 20)], [((5, 5), 15)], [((8, 8), 25), ((9, 9), 30)]]  
Cluster targets:  {0: 15.0, 1: 15.0, 2: 27.5}
Prediction for (5, 10): 27.5


Using average linkage with k=4
Cluster:  [[((1, 1), 10), ((2, 2), 20)], [((5, 5), 15)], [((8, 8), 25)], [((9, 9), 30)]]

Cluster targets:  {0: 15.0, 1: 15.0, 2: 25.0, 3: 30.0}
Prediction for (5,10): 25.0
```

As you can see, we have varying clusters based on `k` value and linkage choice.

‚úÖ **Pros**: Flexible cluster shapes, more accurate in complex distributions.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**: Slower, requires careful choice of `k` and linkage.

---

#### 2. **Divisive Clustering Regression**

Divisive clustering is a top-down approach. It begins with all data points in one cluster and recursively splits them.

**Splitting method used**:

- At each step, the two most distant points are selected.
- All other points are assigned to the closer of the two.
- The smaller of the resulting clusters is considered finalized.

**How it handles regression**:

- Once clustering is complete, each cluster's target value is calculated as the average of the values in that cluster.
- For prediction, a new point is assigned to the cluster with the closest representative (often the medoid).

**Effect of k-values**:

- Higher _k_ leads to smaller clusters, and predictions become more sensitive to local trends.
- Lower _k_ merges more variance into single clusters, leading to more averaged-out predictions.

**Medoid importance**:

- Unlike agglomerative clustering (which may imply centroids), divisive clustering naturally leans toward medoid-based assignment for clearer distance-based decisions.

##### Example output

```python
Cluster:  [[((1, 1), 10), ((2, 2), 20)], [((5, 5), 15), ((8, 8), 25), ((9, 9), 30)]] for k value: 2
Cluster targets:  {0: 15.0, 1: 28.333333333333332} for k value: 2
Prediction for: (5, 10):  28.333333333333332, for k value: 2
Prediction for: (10, 10):  28.333333333333332, for k value: 2
Prediction for: (12, 12):  28.333333333333332, for k value: 2


Cluster:  [[((1, 1), 10), ((2, 2), 20)], [((5, 5), 15)], [((8, 8), 25), ((9, 9), 30)]] for k value: 3
Cluster targets:  {0: 15.0, 1: 30.0, 2: 42.5} for k value: 3
Prediction for: (5, 10):  42.5, for k value: 3
Prediction for: (10, 10):  42.5, for k value: 3
Prediction for: (12, 12):  42.5, for k value: 3


Cluster:  [[((1, 1), 10), ((2, 2), 20)], [((5, 5), 15)], [((9, 9), 30)], [((8, 8), 25)]] for k value: 4
Cluster targets:  {0: 15.0, 1: 30.0, 2: 60.0, 3: 85.0} for k value: 4
Prediction for: (5, 10):  85.0, for k value: 4
Prediction for: (10, 10):  60.0, for k value: 4
Prediction for: (12, 12):  60.0, for k value: 4
```

### **Why All Points Predict the Same in Lower k:**

#### **k = 2:**

- You have only 2 clusters, so:
    - One cluster holds the lower points `((1,1), (2,2))`
    - The other holds the rest, including higher-value targets like 25 and 30.
- All your new points (e.g., `(5, 10)`, `(10, 10)`, `(12, 12)`) are closer to that large high-value cluster.
- ‚û§ So they all map to **target ‚âà 28.3**

#### **k = 3:**

- One more cluster is formed ‚Äî but the farthest points still stick together.
- So your new points still hit the cluster with `((8,8), (9,9))`
- ‚û§ Hence, **same prediction: 42.5**

#### **k = 4:**

- Now the clusters are more fine-tuned.
    - For example, `((8,8), 25)` and `((9,9), 30)` split into different clusters.
- So now, `(5,10)` is closest to **(8,8)** ‚Üí Predicts **85.0**
    
- `(10,10)` and `(12,12)` are closer to **(9,9)** ‚Üí Predicts **60.0**

---
#### 3. K-Means

- **Clustering basis**: Minimizes within-cluster variance (Euclidean distance to centroids).
- **Target Assignment**: Each cluster target is the **mean of all target values** in that cluster.
- **Prediction**: New input is assigned to the closest centroid.
- **Prediction not consistent:** Due to the randomization involved in this algorithm, centroids are picked at random, so the clusters formed in each run of this algorithm are also random, leading to inconsistent predictions as you can see in the output below

##### Example output:

```python
# For the same dataset

labeled_data = [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 5), 20), ((6, 7), 15), ((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)]


# Run 1

Centroids:  [(10.0, 11.0), (7.0, 8.0), (3.0, 4.0)] 

Cluster:  {0: [((10, 11), 30)], 1: [((6, 7), 15), ((8, 9), 25)], 2: [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 
5), 20)]}

Cluster targets:  {0: 30.0, 1: 20.0, 2: 15.0}

Prediction for (3, 4): 15.0

Prediction for (9, 10): 30.0

# Run 2

Centroids:  [(8.0, 9.0), (2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 5.0)] 

Cluster:  {0: [((6, 7), 15), ((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)], 1: [((2, 3), 10)], 2: [((4, 
5), 20)]}

Cluster targets:  {0: 23.333333333333332, 1: 10.0, 2: 20.0}

Prediction for (3, 4): 10.0

Prediction for (9, 10): 23.333333333333332

# Run 3

Centroids:  [(8.0, 9.0), (8, 5), (3.0, 4.0)] 

Cluster:  {0: [((6, 7), 15), ((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)], 1: [], 2: [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 5), 20)]}

Cluster targets:  {0: 23.333333333333332, 1: None, 2: 15.0}

Prediction for (3, 4): 15.0

Prediction for (9, 10): 23.333333333333332

# Run 4 

Centroids:  [(8.0, 9.0), (3.0, 4.0), (1, 8)] 

Cluster:  {0: [((6, 7), 15), ((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)], 1: [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 5), 20)], 2: []}

Cluster targets:  {0: 23.333333333333332, 1: 15.0, 2: None}

Prediction for (3, 4): 15.0

Prediction for (9, 10): 23.333333333333332

```

As you can see, in some cases, different clusters were formed leading to different predictions for the same points across different runs.

---
#### 4. K-Medoids

- Similar to K-Means, but uses **medoids** (real data points) instead of centroids.
- More robust to outliers since it avoids averaging extreme values.

‚úÖ **Pros**: Higher accuracy than K-Means, more stable predictions.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**: Slower than K-Means, especially with large datasets.

The problem of randomness affects K-Medoids as well during prediction, since medoids initially are picked randomly, so clusters are not the same in each run.

##### Example output 

```python

# For the same dataset

labeled_data = [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 5), 20), ((6, 7), 15), ((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)]


# Run 1

Medoids: [((2, 3), 10), ((8, 9), 25), ((6, 7), 15)]
Cluster Assignments: {0: [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 5), 20)], 1: [((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)], 2: [((6, 7), 15)]}
Cluster Target Values: {0: 15.0, 1: 27.5, 2: 15.0}
Prediction for (3, 4): 15.0
Prediction for (9, 10): 27.5


# Run 2

Medoids: [((4, 5), 20), ((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)]
Cluster Assignments: {0: [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 5), 20), ((6, 7), 15)], 1: [((8, 9), 25)], 
2: [((10, 11), 30)]}
Cluster Target Values: {0: 15.0, 1: 25.0, 2: 30.0}
Prediction for (3, 4): 15.0
Prediction for (9, 10): 25.0


# Run 3

Medoids: [((2, 3), 10), ((8, 9), 25), ((4, 5), 20)]
Cluster Assignments: {0: [((2, 3), 10)], 1: [((8, 9), 25), ((10, 11), 30)], 2: [((4, 5), 20), ((6, 7), 15)]}
Cluster Target Values: {0: 10.0, 1: 27.5, 2: 17.5}
Prediction for (3, 4): 10.0
Prediction for (9, 10): 27.5

# Run 4

Medoids: [((10, 11), 30), ((2, 3), 10), ((6, 7), 15)]
Cluster Assignments: {0: [((10, 11), 30)], 1: [((2, 3), 10), ((4, 5), 20)], 2: [((6, 7), 15), ((8, 9), 25)]}
Cluster Target Values: {0: 30.0, 1: 15.0, 2: 20.0}
Prediction for (3, 4): 15.0
Prediction for (9, 10): 30.0

```

As you can see, in some cases, different clusters were formed leading to different predictions for the same points across different runs.

---
### Takeaway from these example outputs :

- **Higher k ‚Üí More diverse predictions**
- **Medoid location** (used internally for prediction) plays a huge role.
- **Better clustering = better regression resolution**.
- **Careful choice of linkage algorithm (Agglomerative) = better cluster formation = more diverse prediction possibility.**
- **Partitioning algorithms are affected by randomness, leading to inconsistent predictions across different runs.**
- **As a result, hierarchical clustering perform better than partitioning algorithms on cluster formation and regression**.
 
---

### General Observations on Clustering-Based Regression

- **Tradeoff between bias and variance**: Fewer clusters mean more general predictions (high bias), while more clusters capture finer detail but may overfit (high variance).
- **Choice of clustering algorithm affects prediction quality**: Algorithms that better preserve natural groupings of data provide more accurate regression estimates.
- **Choosing between centroid vs medoid**: Centroids (means) can be misleading with outliers or non-convex distributions. Medoids (actual data points) are often more robust.

This approach is useful when explicit regression models are hard to define or when data shows natural groupings. It offers a way to incorporate the structure of the input space into predictions, making it valuable for complex or noisy datasets.

# Transactional Patterns

Transactional data mining¬†==focuses on identifying patterns and relationships within datasets that represent transactions, such as sales, purchases, or website interactions==.¬†These patterns can be used for various purposes, like market basket analysis, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frequent-pattern-mining-in-data-mining/


Key aspects of transactional data mining:

- **Frequent Pattern Mining:**
    
    This involves finding sets of items that frequently occur together in a ==transactional database==.¬†
    
- **Association Rule Mining:**
    
    This technique identifies rules that describe relationships between items in a dataset.¬†For example, a rule might indicate that customers who buy bread and milk are likely to buy eggs.¬†

For more on association, refer to module 1

- **Sequence Pattern Mining:**
    
    This focuses on identifying patterns that occur in a specific sequence over time, such as website click-streams or customer purchase sequences.¬†
    

- **Data Preprocessing:**
    
    Data needs to be prepared before mining, including handling missing values, cleaning data, and transforming it into a suitable format.¬†
    

Examples of transactional data mining applications:

- **Market Basket Analysis:**
    
    Identifying products that are frequently purchased together to optimize product placement, promotions, and inventory management.¬†
    

- **Fraud Detection:**
    
    Analyzing transactional data to identify suspicious patterns that might indicate fraudulent activities, like credit card fraud or insurance fraud.¬†
    

- **Recommendation Systems:**
    
    Suggesting products or services to customers based on their past purchase history or browsing behavior.¬†
    
- **Customer Segmentation:**
    
    Grouping customers based on their purchasing habits to personalize marketing efforts and tailor product offerings.¬†
    

Algorithms used in transactional data mining:

- **Apriori Algorithm:**
    
    A classic algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in transactional databases.
    

- **FP-Growth Algorithm:**
    
    Another popular algorithm for frequent pattern mining, known for its efficiency.
    

- **Other Algorithms:**
    
    Various other algorithms are used, including ECLAT, RARM, and ASPMS, each with its strengths and weaknesses.


---
## Frequent Item sets

- A **frequent itemset** is a set of items that occur together in a transactional dataset **more often than a minimum support threshold**.
    
- `Support` = The proportion of transactions in which the itemset appears.

**Example**:

```python
Transactions:
T1: {A, B, C}
T2: {A, B}
T3: {A, C}
T4: {B, C}
T5: {A, B, C}
```

If `min_support = 0.6`  (3 out of 5 transactions), then the frequent item sets would be:

```python
{A} appears 4/5 ‚Üí Frequent
{B} appears 4/5 ‚Üí Frequent
{C} appears 4/5 ‚Üí Frequent
{A, B} appears 3/5 ‚Üí Frequent
{A, C} appears 3/5 ‚Üí Frequent
{B, C} appears 3/5 ‚Üí Frequent
{A, B, C} appears 2/5 ‚Üí Not Frequent (below 0.6)
```

---
## Closed Item sets

- A **closed itemset** is a frequent itemset **that has no immediate superset with the same support**.
- It tells you the most **concise representation** of frequent patterns.

**Example (continued):** If `{A, B}` and `{A, B, C}` have the same support, `{A, B}` is **not closed** ‚Äî because `{A, B, C}` exists and has the same count.

If `{A, B}` has support 3, and `{A, B, C}` has support 2, `{A, B}` is **closed**.

---
## Association Rules (important)

An **association rule** is an implication of the form:

What is an implication btw?

It's a simple rule we studied back in automata theory which states that :

```python
if {a} then {b}
```

or 

$$If \ p \ \rightarrow q$$


It has two key metrics:

- **Support** ‚Äî How frequently {A, B} occurs.
- **Confidence** ‚Äî The probability of {B} given {A}.


```python
Confidence = Support({A, B}) / Support({A})
```

And sometimes:

- **Lift** measures the strength compared to random chance.


```python
Lift = Confidence / Support({B})
```

---
## Antecedent and Consequent in Association Rules (Important)

In **Association Rules**, the terminology is inspired by logic:

- **Antecedent (LHS)**: the "if" part of the rule ‚Äî the condition.
- **Consequent (RHS)**: the "then" part of the rule ‚Äî the outcome.


üí° **Example:**

If you find a frequent itemset `{Bread, Butter}`, you can generate two rules:

1. **Bread ‚áí Butter**
2. **Butter ‚áí Bread**

Here:

- For rule **Bread ‚áí Butter**:  
    ‚ÄÉ`Antecedent = {Bread}`  
    ‚ÄÉ`Consequent = {Butter}`
    
- For rule **Butter ‚áí Bread**:  
    ‚ÄÉ`Antecedent = {Butter}`  
    ‚ÄÉ`Consequent = {Bread}`


When computing **confidence**:

```python
Confidence = Support(Itemset) / Support(Antecedent)
```

```python
Rule: Bread ‚áí Butter
Support({Bread, Butter}) = 0.8
Support({Bread}) = 1.0
```

```python
Confidence = 0.8 / 1.0 = 0.8
```

### **Frequent Itemset Mining**

- The **process** of finding all the itemsets that meet the minimum support in a dataset.
- This is the core job of algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth.
- Once you get the itemsets, you can **generate rules** from them.

---
# 1. Apriori Algorithm -- Association Rule Mining


## üí° **What is Apriori?**

The **Apriori algorithm** is a classic algorithm in **data mining** used for **association rule learning**.  
Its purpose is to identify **frequent itemsets** in large transactional datasets and extract **association rules** ‚Äî relationships that show how the occurrence of one item affects the occurrence of another.

---

## üéØ **Objective**

- Discover sets of items (`itemsets`) that frequently occur together.
- Use these sets to generate rules that predict item presence based on other items in a transaction.

---

## üìö **Terminology**

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Transaction|A single record/list of items bought together.|
|Itemset|A set of items (e.g., {Milk, Bread}).|
|Support|Fraction of transactions that contain the itemset.|
|Minimum Support|Threshold to consider an itemset as "frequent."|
|Confidence|Probability that consequent is present given antecedent.|
|Minimum Confidence|Threshold to consider a rule as valid.|

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Algorithm Overview**

The Apriori algorithm follows this fundamental structure:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Frequent Itemsets**

1. **Scan the dataset** to count individual items (1-itemsets).
2. Remove items that don‚Äôt meet `minimum support`.
3. Use the remaining items to generate **candidate 2-itemsets**.
4. Scan the dataset again to count the frequency of these pairs.
5. Remove itemsets that don‚Äôt meet `minimum support`.
6. Repeat the process to generate `k-itemsets` until no more frequent itemsets can be found.

> üß† **Apriori Principle**:  
> If an itemset is frequent, all of its subsets must also be frequent.  
> If a subset is infrequent, any superset of it will be infrequent too.

---
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Association Rules

Once frequent itemsets are found:

1. For each frequent itemset:
    
    - Break it into **antecedent ‚Üí consequent** pairs.
    - Compute **Confidence**:
        
        $$\text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cup B)}{\text{Support}(A)}$$‚Äã

2. If Confidence ‚â• `minimum confidence` ‚Äî accept the rule.
    
3. Else, discard the rule.
---

##  **Example**

### üíº Dataset:

|Transaction ID|Items|
|---|---|
|1|{Milk, Bread, Butter}|
|2|{Bread, Butter}|
|3|{Milk, Bread}|
|4|{Bread, Butter}|
|5|{Milk, Bread, Butter}|

### üéØ Minimum Support: `0.6`

(meaning itemsets must occur in at least 3 out of 5 transactions)

---

### üßæ **Step 1: 1-Itemsets**

|Item|Count|Support|
|---|---|---|
|Milk|3|0.6|
|Bread|5|1.0|
|Butter|4|0.8|

All items meet the minimum support. Keep all.

---

### üßæ **Step 2: 2-Itemsets**

Generate combinations from {Milk, Bread, Butter}:

|Itemset|Count|Support|
|---|---|---|
|{Milk, Bread}|3|0.6|
|{Milk, Butter}|2|0.4 ‚ùå|
|{Bread, Butter}|4|0.8|

Only `{Milk, Butter}` is removed.

---
### üßæ **Step 3: 3-Itemsets**

Generate combinations from surviving items:

|Itemset|Count|Support|
|---|---|---|
|{Milk, Bread, Butter}|2|0.4 ‚ùå|

Doesn‚Äôt meet `0.6` support. Discard.

---
### ‚úÖ **Final Frequent Itemsets**

- `{Milk}`
- `{Bread}`
- `{Butter}`
- `{Milk, Bread}`
- `{Bread, Butter}`

---
### üîÅ **Step 4: Generate Association Rules**

Now check each itemset with 2 or more items:

#### For `{Milk, Bread}`:

- `Milk ‚Üí Bread`: $\frac{3}{3} = 1.03$ ‚úÖ
- `Bread ‚Üí Milk`: $\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$ ‚úÖ

#### For `{Bread, Butter}`:

- `Bread ‚Üí Butter`: $\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$ ‚úÖ
- `Butter ‚Üí Bread`: $\frac{4}{4} = 1.0$ ‚úÖ

---

## üéâ **Resulting Association Rules**

|Rule|Confidence|
|---|---|
|Milk ‚Üí Bread|1.0|
|Bread ‚Üí Milk|0.6|
|Bread ‚Üí Butter|0.8|
|Butter ‚Üí Bread|1.0|

---

## üí° **Summary**

- Apriori uses the **downward closure property** to prune unpromising candidates early.
- It incrementally builds larger item sets from smaller frequent ones.
- Association rules are formed based on the **confidence metric**.
- Simple, interpretable, but computationally heavy for very large datasets.

---

## üß† **When to Use Apriori**

- When datasets are **small to medium**.
- When rules should be **transparent** and **easily explainable**.
- When you can tolerate multiple dataset scans.

---

**Output:**

Count of Butter = 4
Count of ('Milk', 'Bread') = 3
Count of ('Milk', 'Butter') = 2
Count of ('Bread', 'Butter') = 4
Count of ('Bread', 'Milk', 'Butter') = 2
All support dictionaries:
{'Milk': 0.6, 'Bread': 1.0, 'Butter': 0.8}
{('Milk', 'Bread'): 0.6, ('Bread', 'Butter'): 0.8}
{}


All item sets:
[{'Milk': 3, 'Bread': 5, 'Butter': 4}, {('Milk', 'Bread'): 3, ('Bread', 'Butter'): 4}, {}]


Confidence for ('Milk', 'Bread') with antecedent as Milk = 1.0
Confidence for ('Milk', 'Bread') with antecedent as Bread = 0.6
Confidence for ('Bread', 'Butter') with antecedent as Bread = 0.8
Confidence for ('Bread', 'Butter') with antecedent as Butter = 1.0
All association rules:
[{('Milk', 'Bread'): 1.0, ('Bread', 'Milk'): 0.6}, {('Bread', 'Butter'): 0.8, ('Butter', 'Bread'): 1.0}]
```

**Note that this code is for theoretical understanding purposes only, I haven't extended multi-item antecedent and consequent support or handling of k-frequent itemset generations**

This output would indicate something like:

```python
If a customer buys Milk, they are likely to also buy ('Bread',) (Confidence: 1.00)
If a customer buys Bread, they are likely to also buy ('Butter',) (Confidence: 0.80)
```

---
### **Why does this matter in business?**

- Shops can arrange `Bread` near `Milk` because people who buy Milk tend to also buy Bread.
- Discounts can be structured.
- Inventory planning.
- Cross-selling offers.

# 2. F-P Growth Algorithm -- Association rule mining

## üí° **What is F-P Growth?**

The **Frequent Pattern Growth (F-P Growth)** algorithm is an advanced method for mining frequent itemsets without generating candidate sets like Apriori.

It uses a compressed structure called an **FP-Tree (Frequent Pattern Tree)** to store transactions, and extracts frequent patterns directly from it.

---

## **Why F-P Growth over Apriori?**

|Apriori|F-P Growth|
|---|---|
|Generates candidates repeatedly.|No candidate generation.|
|Multiple full-dataset scans.|Usually 2 full-dataset scans only.|
|Memory-heavy for large datasets.|Uses compact FP-Tree for compression.|
|Slower with dense datasets.|Faster with both dense and sparse data.|

---
## **Algorithm Flow**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Scan Dataset & Count Frequencies**

- Go through the dataset once.
- Count the frequency of each item.
- Discard items below **minimum support**.
- Sort the surviving items in descending order of frequency.

---
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Build the FP-Tree**

- Initialize the root as `null`.
- For each transaction:
    - **Sort items** according to global frequency.
    - **Insert items as a path** into the tree.
    - If part of the path already exists, increment the count at the node.
- Store links between nodes with the same item using a **header table** for fast access.

---

### ü™µ **Example FP-Tree Build**

Given transactions:

|TID|Items|
|---|---|
|1|{Milk, Bread, Butter}|
|2|{Bread, Butter}|
|3|{Milk, Bread}|
|4|{Bread, Butter}|
|5|{Milk, Bread, Butter}|

1. Count frequencies:  
    Milk=3, Bread=5, Butter=4.
2. Minimum support = 0.6  
    Valid items: Milk, Bread, Butter.
3. Sort each transaction‚Äôs items by frequency:  
    Order: Bread > Butter > Milk.

Example insertion for T1 `{Bread, Butter, Milk}`:

```python
Root
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Bread (1)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Butter (1)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Milk (1)
```

Further transactions add to this tree or extend new branches as needed.

---
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Mine the FP-Tree (Recursive Extraction)**

- For each item (lowest frequency first):
    - Extract its **conditional pattern base** (prefix paths leading to the item).
    - Build a **conditional FP-Tree** from this base.
    - Recursively repeat the process on this new tree.
- Combine found patterns to produce all frequent itemsets.

---
## **Conditional Pattern Base Example**

Let‚Äôs say for item `Butter`:  
You gather paths like:

```python
{Bread} : count 2
{Milk, Bread} : count 2
```

---
##  **Final Output**

A complete list of **frequent itemsets** that meet the `minimum support` threshold ‚Äî just like Apriori, but found without brute-force combination testing.

---
##  **Why is this Efficient?**

- **Compression:** Repeated item combinations are stored in compact tree paths.
- **No candidate generation:** Saves computation time.
- **Less scanning:** Only 2 passes over the dataset.
- **Recursive mining:** Breaks down large problems into smaller ones via conditional trees.

---

## **When to Use F-P Growth?**

- When the dataset is too large or dense for Apriori.
- When you need quick frequent pattern mining.
- When memory can handle tree-based storage.

---

**Summary:**

- Apriori is easy to understand and implement.
- F-P Growth is faster, cleaner, and smarter.
- Both aim to solve the same problem ‚Äî mining frequent itemsets ‚Äî but F-P Growth does it with structural optimization.

#  Temporal Frequent Patterns

In real-world datasets, patterns don‚Äôt just exist in a static basket. They often **change over time** or occur **in sequences**. Here are some of the most interesting types:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Sequential Patterns**

- Focus: _Order matters._
- Example:  
    A customer buys `Milk ‚Üí Bread ‚Üí Butter` across different visits, not in one basket.
    
- Algorithms:
    
    - **AprioriAll**
    - **GSP (Generalized Sequential Pattern)**
    - **PrefixSpan**

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Episode Patterns**

- Focus: _Events occurring close together in time windows._
- Example:  
    In a server log:
    
```
[Login Fail] ‚Üí [Brute Force Detected] ‚Üí [Firewall Alert]
```

‚Äî these happen within a 5-minute window often, but not necessarily in exact order.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Time-Decay Frequent Patterns**

- Focus: _Recent patterns weigh more than old ones._
    
- Example:  
    A store might give more weight to recent buying behavior to detect trends rather than treating old and new sales equally.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Periodicity Mining**

- Focus: _Patterns that repeat at regular intervals._
    
- Example:  
    A user might always order pizza on Fridays or there are server downtimes every night at 2 AM.
    
---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Temporal Association Rules**

- Extends classic association rules with timestamps.
- Example:
    
```
IF {Bread} is bought on Monday ‚Üí THEN {Butter} is bought within 2 days (confidence 0.8)
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Spatio-Temporal Patterns**

- Focus: _Location + Time combined._
- Example:

```
People at [Location: Gym] ‚Üí buy [Item: Protein Shake] within 10 minutes.
```

|Pattern Type|Use-case|Common Algorithm|
|---|---|---|
|Sequential Patterns|Web clickstreams, purchase sequences|PrefixSpan, SPADE|
|Episode Patterns|Event logs, anomaly detection|WINEPI, MINEPI|
|Time-Decay Frequent Patterns|Trending topics, hot products|Stream Mining|
|Periodicity Mining|Predictable habits / maintenance cycles|TSP, WARP|
|Temporal Association Rules|Time-based "if-then" patterns|T-Apriori|
|Spatio-Temporal Patterns|Mobility and behavior based on location & time|STPM, ST-Miner|
