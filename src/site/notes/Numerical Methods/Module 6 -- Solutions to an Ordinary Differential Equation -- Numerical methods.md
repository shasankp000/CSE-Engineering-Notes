# 1. Euler's Method

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukNbG7muKho

## Concept

Eulerâ€™s method is the simplest numerical method for solving an initial value problem of the form:

$$ \frac{dy}{dt} \ = \ f(t, y),  \ y(t_0) \ = \ y_0 $$



It approximates the solution by moving a small step size $h$ forward in time and using the derivative $f(t,y)$ to update the value of $y$.

---
## Formula

If you know $y(t_n)$ and want to compute  $y(t_{n+1})$ with a step $h$:

$$y_{n+1} \ = \ y_n \ + \ h \ f'(t_n, y_n)$$


where $h$ is the step size.

---
## Pros and Cons

- **Pros:**
    
    - Very simple to implement.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - It is only first-order accurate (error is proportional to $h$); hence, for a given step size $h$, it may not be very accurate.
    - It may require very small step sizes to achieve acceptable accuracy, increasing computational cost.

----
### Example 1

So let's say we have this equation and it's derivative :

![Pasted image 20250411202425.png](/img/user/media/Pasted%20image%2020250411202425.png)


**Note that this is an explicit equation, so we need to find out the derivative ourselves**.

We need to approximate the value of $y$ when $x \ = \ 1.5$.

So, since this method requires very small step sizes for good accuracy, let's set :

$$h \ = \ 0.1$$

Another of finding the step size would be:

First, let $x \ = \ 1.5 \ = \ b$  and the starting point $x \ = \ 1 \ = \ a$ (since we take $x, \ y \ = \ (1, 1)$) as the initial points


$$h \ = \ \frac{b-a}{n}$$


So if we took $n \ = \ 4$,

then :

$$h \ = \ \frac{0.5}{4} \ = \ 0.125$$


which results in a more precise step size, so we might get a more precise value if we use this step size.

But for consistency with the example in the video, we will use $h \ = \ 0.1$.

So here :

$$f(x) \ = x^2$$


$$f'(x) \ = \ 2x$$


So since our equation depends on $x$, so we will use the equation :

$$y_{n+1} \ = \ y_n \ + \ h \ f'(x_n)$$


So let's create a table first :


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
|     |       |       |              |

And start off with the initial point P(1,1), where $x_n \ = \ 1$ and $y_n \ = \ 1$ and $n \ = \ 0$.


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     |              |

Here $x_n \ = \ x_n \ + \ h$

So the value of $x_n$ will increase by the step size.

Now we use the equation :


$$y_{n+1} \ = \ y_n \ + \ h \ f'(x)$$


to predict the values for the next iterations.

We will continue till $n \  = \ 4$, that way we get the value till $y_5$ or $n \ = \ 5$ iterations.


So, for $n \ = \ 0$, 

$$y_{1} \ = \ y_0 \ + \ 0.1 \ \times \ (2 \ \times 1)$$


$$\implies y_{1.1} \ = \ 1 \ + \ 0.2 \ = \ 1.2$$

| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     |              |
| 1   | 1.1   | 1.2   |              |

Next, for $n \ = \ 1$

$$y_{2} \ = \ y_{1} \ + \ 0.1 \ \times \ (2 \ \times \ 1.1)$$


$$y_{2} \ = \ 1.2 \ + \ 0.1 \ \times 2.2 \ = \ 1.2 \ + \ 0.22 $$

$$y_{2} \ = \ 1.42$$


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     |              |
| 1   | 1.1   | 1.2   |              |
| 2   | 1.2   | 1.42  |              |
| 3   | 1.3   |       |              |
| 4   | 1.4   |       |              |
| 5   | 1.5   |       |              |

Next, for $n \ = \ 2$

$$y_3 \ = \ y_2 \ + \ 0.1 \ \times (2 \ \times \ 1.2)$$


$$y_4 \ = \ 1.42 \ + \ 0.24$$

$$y_3 \ = \ 1.66$$


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     |              |
| 1   | 1.1   | 1.2   |              |
| 2   | 1.2   | 1.42  |              |
| 3   | 1.3   | 1.66  |              |
| 4   | 1.4   |       |              |
| 5   | 1.5   |       |              |

Next, for $n \ = \ 3$

$$y_4 \ = \ y_3 \ + \ 0.1 \ \times \ (2 \ \times 1.3)$$

$$\implies y_4 \ = \ 1.66 \ + \ 0.1 \ \times \ (2 \ \times 1.3)$$

$$\implies y_4 \ = \ 1.66 \ + \ 0.26$$

$$\implies y_4 \ = \ 1.92$$


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     |              |
| 1   | 1.1   | 1.2   |              |
| 2   | 1.2   | 1.42  |              |
| 3   | 1.3   | 1.66  |              |
| 4   | 1.4   | 1.92  |              |
| 5   | 1.5   |       |              |

Now, for $n \ = \ 4$

$$y_5 \ = \ y_4 \ + \ 0.1 \ \times (2 \ \times 1.4)$$


$$y_5 \ = \ 1.92 \ + \ 0.1 \ \times \ (2 \ \times \ 1.4)$$

$$y_5 \ = \ 1.92 \ + \ 0.28 \ = \ 2.2$$

| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     |              |
| 1   | 1.1   | 1.2   |              |
| 2   | 1.2   | 1.42  |              |
| 3   | 1.3   | 1.66  |              |
| 4   | 1.4   | 1.92  |              |
| 5   | 1.5   | 2.2   |              |

Now, time to find out the actual values per value of $x_n$

So we will use the original equation, $y \ = \ x^2$ .

So, $y(1) \ = 1$


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     | 1            |
| 1   | 1.1   | 1.2   |              |
| 2   | 1.2   | 1.42  |              |
| 3   | 1.3   | 1.66  |              |
| 4   | 1.4   | 1.92  |              |
| 5   | 1.5   | 1.1   |              |

$y(1.1) \ = \ 1.21$

$y(1.2) \ = \ 1.44$

$y(1.3) \ = \ 1.69$

$y(1.4) \ = \ 1.96$

$y(1.5) \ = \ 2.25$

| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | Actual value |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0   | 1     | 1     | 1            |
| 1   | 1.1   | 1.2   | 1.21         |
| 2   | 1.2   | 1.42  | 1.44         |
| 3   | 1.3   | 1.66  | 1.69         |
| 4   | 1.4   | 1.92  | 1.96         |
| 5   | 1.5   | 2.2   | 2.25         |

So, we get our final approximation of $y(1.5)$  as $2.2$, which is real close to the actual value, $2.25$

What is the "actual value" btw?

In the cases of ODEs and not explicit equations, it's used to update the value of $y_n$, but it's not considered the **actual approximation** itself.

So our final answer will be $2.2$.

## Example 2

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8-4HLKtmDM&list=PLU6SqdYcYsfLrTna7UuaVfGZYkNo0cpVC&index=10


![Pasted image 20250412124802.png](/img/user/media/Pasted%20image%2020250412124802.png)

**Note that this is NOT an explicit equation, but rather an ODE, so we don't need to find out the derivative ourselves**.

In this case, the formula becomes :

$$y_{n+1} \ = \ y_n \ + \ h \ f(x,y)$$

Since our given $f(x,y)$ is already the derivative itself. 

So we are given a starting condition as :

$y \ = \ 1$ and $x \ = \ 0$  and we need to find $y$ at $x \ = \ 0.1$

Let's compute till $n \ = \ 5$.

So the step size will be :

$$h \ = \ \frac{0.1 \ - \ 0}{5} \ = \ 0.02$$

So using that we construct our table:


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | $f(x,y)$ |
| --- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 0   | 0     | 1     | 1        |
| 1   | 0.02  | 1.02  | 1.04     |
| 2   | 0.04  | 1.04  | 1.08     |
| 3   | 0.06  | 1.06  | 1.12     |
| 4   | 0.08  | 1.08  | 1.16     |
| 5   | 0.1   | 1.11  | 1.21     |

I got the values early on since I made a program to calculate all this 

```python
[[0, 0, 1, 1]]
[[1, 0.02, 1.0204, 1.0404]]
[[2, 0.04, 1.0416079999999999, 1.081608]]
[[3, 0.06, 1.0636401599999998, 1.1236401599999999]]
[[4, 0.08, 1.0865129632, 1.1665129632]]
[[5, 0.1, 1.110243222464, 1.210243222464]]
The value of y at x = 0.1 is: 1.110243222464 
```

However I will do some of them by hand to clear up any confusion.

So for $n=0$

$$y_1 \ = \ y_0 \ + \ h \ f(x_0, \ y_0)$$

$$\implies y_1 \ = \ 1 \ + \ 0.02 \ \times (0 \ + \ 1)$$

$$\implies y_1 \ = \ 1.02$$

Similarly for $n \ = \ 1$

$$y_2 \ = \ 1.02 \ + \ 0.02 \ \times (0.02 \ + \ 1.02)$$

$$\implies y_@ \ = \ 1.02 \ + \ 0.00208$$

$$\implies y_2 \ \approx \ 1.04$$

And so on... I assume you can do the rest of the  calculations by yourself.


So the final approximation of $y(0.1)$  is $1.1102$.
And the value in the video was obtained as $1.108$ is due to precision differences.

# 2. Runge-Kutta Method (or Euler's Modified Method)

This method is used for 2nd order differential equations.

This is based upon Euler's method by modifying it.

$$y^*_{n+1} \ = \ y_n \ + \ h \ f(x_n, \ y_n)$$

(obtained by using Euler's method)

then, we use this to get :

$$y_{n+1} \ = \ y_{n} \ + \ \frac{h}{2} \ [\ f(x_n, y_n) \ + \ f(x_{n+1}, \ y^{*}_{n+1}) \ ]$$


## Example 1:

Let's say we have :

![Pasted image 20250412183533.png](/img/user/media/Pasted%20image%2020250412183533.png)


$$\frac{dy}{dx} \ = \ x^2 \ + \ y$$

Another ODE, not an explicit equation.

We are given the starting conditions as $y(0) \ = \ 1$ which means :

$x_0 \ = \ 0 ;  \ y_0 \ = \ 1$

And we are asked to find the value of $y$  at $x \ = \ 0.02$  and $x \ = \ 0.04$


So if we continue till $n \ = \ 5$, then the step size, $h$  will can be taken for simplicity purposes as :

$h \ = \ 0.02$

Since we will be finding for two $x$ values and the difference between then is $0.02$  so for simplicity purposes we can take $0.02$

Or for better accuracy we can :

$$h \ = \ \frac{0.02}{5} \ = \ 0.004$$

Let's find out which step size leads to more precise answer :

So, at $n \ = \ 0 \ and \ h  \ = \ 0.02$

We will have our table as :


| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$ | $f(x_n, y_n)$ |
| --- | ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| 0   | 0     | 1     | 1             |
| 1   | 0.02  |       |               |
| 2   | 0.04  |       |               |
| 3   | 0.06  |       |               |
| 4   | 0.08  |       |               |
| 5   | 0.10  |       |               |

We see that we can get the required $x_n$  values at a lesser number of iterations if we use $h \ = \ 0.004$




$$y^{*}_1 \ = \ y_0 \ + \ 0.02 \ \times (0^2 \ + \ 1)$$

$$\implies \ y^{*}_1 \ = \ 1 \ + \ 0.02 \ = \ 1.02$$


And $$y_{1} \ = \ 1 \ + \frac{0.02}{2} \ \times [\ (0^2 \ + \ 1) \ + \ (0.02^2 \ + \ 1.02) ]$$


$$\implies y_1 \ = \ 1 \ + \ (0.01 \ \times 2.0204)$$

$$\implies y_1 \ = \ 1 \ + \ 0.0020204 \ = \ 1.020204$$



Now at $n \ = \ 1$

$$y^{*}_2 \ = \ y_1 \ + \ 0.02 \ \times (0.02^2 \ + \ 1.020204)$$

$$\implies y^{*}_2 \ = \ 1.020204 \ + \ (0.02 \ \times 1.020604)$$


$$\implies y^{*}_2 \ = \ 1.020204 \ + \ 0.02041208$$


$$\implies y^{*}_2 \ = \ 1.04061608$$



Now, 

$$y_2 \ = \ 1.020204 \ + \ 0.02 \ \times [ \ (0.02^2 \ + \ 1.020204) \ + \ (0.04^2 \ + \ 1.04061608) \ ] $$

$$y_2 \ = \ 1.020204 \ + \ \frac{0.02}{2} \ \times [\ 0.02041208  \ + \ 1.04221608   \ ]$$

$$y_2 \ = \ 1.020204 \ + \ 0.01 \ \times 1.06262816$$


$$\implies y_2 \ = \ 1.020204 \ + \   0.0106262816 $$


$$\implies \ y_2 \ = \ 1.030830282$$



| n   | $x_n$ | $y_n$       | $f(x_n, y_n)$ |
| --- | ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0   | 0     | 1           | 1             |
| 1   | 0.02  | 1.020204    | 0.0020204     |
| 2   | 0.04  | 1.030830282 |  0.0106262816 |
| 3   | 0.06  |             |               |
| 4   | 0.08  |             |               |
| 5   | 0.10  |             |               |


So we have our as $y(0.02) \ = \ 1.020204$  and $y(0.04) \ = \ 1.030830282$
