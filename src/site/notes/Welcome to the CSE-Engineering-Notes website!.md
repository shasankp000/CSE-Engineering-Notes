# Welcome to the CSE-Engineering-Notes website!

A free repository of high quality crafted notes for the average computer science student.

## What is this website about?

Hello I am Shasank (www.github.com/shasankp000)

I made this notes website so that I and my friends and whoever that comes here has access to a free repository of high quality notes on a various number of topics under CS, starting from Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning and so on...

And to also bypass the very poor quality of education we are offered at my college.

# Check out my other projects if you are interested.

1. AI Player: https://github.com/shasankp000/AI-Player (my latest and most popular project)
2. PyMicMute: https://github.com/shasankp000/PyMicMute (a solution I came up with, for a friend).
3. PyCraft: https://github.com/shasankp000/PyCraft (my first big project ever which is also why it also contains the most unoptimized garbage spaghetti code, but it still managed to go global and rake up a lot of stars lol.)
4. DSA-C: https://github.com/shasankp000/DSA-C (Basically me learning and practicing DSA in C, might be useful for some people idk.)
5. PySQL: https://github.com/shasankp000/PySQL (my first python project that I built while I was still at school lol)
