# Introduction

==Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding==.

Let's dive deeper into the introductory aspects of NLP.

I didn't spend much effort on this watered down version as there is not much to understand based on the syllabus and lack of content in general. But I will soon work on a completely detailed and in-depth material on NLP for learning AI in general, once this exam is done.

# Syntactic Processing

==**Syntactic processing** is the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences. It involves identifying the parts of speech, phrases, and the relationships between them==. This analysis helps computers understand the underlying meaning of a sentence.

### Key Concepts in Syntactic Processing

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:**
    - ==Assigning a grammatical category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence.==
    - Example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
        - POS tags: DT JJ NN VBZ IN DT JJ NN

- **Chunking:**
    - ==Identifying phrases (noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.) within a sentence==.
    - Example: "The quick brown fox" is a noun phrase.

- **Parsing:**
    - ==Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to create a parse tree==.
    - Two main types of parsing:
        - **Constituency parsing:** Breaking down a sentence into its constituent parts.
        - **Dependency parsing:** Identifying the relationships between words in a sentence.

### Challenges in Syntactic Processing

- **Ambiguity:**
    - A sentence can have multiple possible interpretations. For example, "I saw the man with the telescope."
- **Language Variation:**
    - Different languages have different grammatical rules and structures.
- **Noise and Errors:**
    - Real-world text often contains typos, misspellings, and other errors.

### Applications of Syntactic Processing

- **Machine Translation:**
    - Understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence is crucial for accurate translation.
- **Text Summarization:**
    - Identifying the main ideas and supporting details in a text.
- **Information Extraction:**
    - Extracting specific information from text, such as names, dates, and locations.
- **Natural Language Understanding:**
    - Enabling computers to understand the meaning of text.

---
## Parsing Techniques

==**Parsing** is the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence==. It involves breaking down the sentence into its constituent parts and identifying the relationships between them.
### Main Parsing Techniques

1. **Constituency Parsing:**
    
    - Breaks down a sentence into a hierarchical structure of phrases.
    - Each phrase is a constituent of a larger phrase.
    - Uses phrase structure rules to generate parse trees.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```
        S -> NP VP
        NP -> DT NN | JJ NN
        VP -> VB NP | VB ADVP NP
        ```
        
    - **Challenge:** Can be computationally expensive, especially for complex sentences.
2. **Dependency Parsing:**
    
    - Identifies the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.
    - Focuses on the dependencies between words, rather than phrases.
    - Produces a dependency tree, where words are nodes and edges represent dependencies.
    - **Example:**

```        
[The] --det-> [quick] --amod-> [brown] --amod-> [fox] --nsubj-> [jumps] --advmod-> [over] --prep-> [the] --det-> [lazy] --amod-> [dog]
```

- **Advantage:** Simpler and more efficient than constituency parsing.
---
### Challenges in Handling Ambiguous Sentences

Ambiguous sentences can pose significant challenges to parsing algorithms. Here are some common types of ambiguity:

1. **Lexical Ambiguity:**
    
    - A word can have multiple meanings.
    - Example: "The bank is open." (financial institution or river bank)
2. **Structural Ambiguity:**
    
    - A sentence can have multiple possible syntactic structures.
    - Example: "I saw the man with the telescope." (Did I use a telescope to see the man, or was the man holding a telescope?)
3. **Reference Ambiguity:**
    
    - Pronouns or other references can be ambiguous.
    - Example: "John said Mary liked him. She smiled." (Who does "she" refer to, John or Mary?)

---
### Techniques for Handling Ambiguity

- **Statistical Parsing:**
    - Uses statistical models to assign probabilities to different parse trees.
    - More likely parse trees are preferred.

- **Semantic Information:**
    - Using semantic information can help disambiguate sentences.
    - For example, knowing the meaning of words can help resolve lexical ambiguity.

- **Contextual Information:**
    - Considering the context of a sentence can help resolve reference ambiguity.
    - For example, the surrounding text can help determine the antecedent of a pronoun.
---
# Semantic Analysis

==**Semantic analysis** is the process of understanding the meaning of text. It involves extracting the underlying meaning of words, phrases, and sentences==. This is a crucial step in many NLP applications, such as machine translation, information extraction, and text summarization.

Kinda similar to how semantics are used in parsing for various LR(1) grammars in compiler design.

---
### Key Concepts in Semantic Analysis

- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):**
    - Determining the correct meaning of a word based on the context.
    - Example: The word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.
      
- **Semantic Role Labeling:**
    - Identifying the semantic roles of words in a sentence, such as agent, patient, instrument, etc.
    - Example: In the sentence "The cat chased the mouse with a stick," "cat" is the agent, "mouse" is the patient, and "stick" is the instrument.
      
- **Textual Entailment:**
    - Determining whether one text logically implies another.
    - Example: Given the sentences "The sky is blue" and "It is daytime," the first sentence entails the second.

---
### Challenges in Semantic Analysis

- **Word Sense Disambiguation:**
    - Many words have multiple meanings, and the correct meaning often depends on the context.
- **Semantic Role Labeling:**
    - Identifying the correct semantic roles can be challenging, especially in complex sentences.
