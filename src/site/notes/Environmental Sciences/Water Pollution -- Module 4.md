# Hydrological Cycle (Water Cycle)

![Pasted image 20240622020136.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240622020136.png)

The hydrological cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The key processes involved are:

1. **Evaporation:** Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers heats up and turns into water vapor, entering the atmosphere.
2. **Transpiration:** Water absorbed by plants from the soil is released into the atmosphere as water vapor through tiny pores in leaves.
3. **Condensation:** Water vapor in the atmosphere cools and turns into liquid water, forming clouds.
4. **Precipitation:** Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, returning to the Earth's surface.
5. **Infiltration:** Some of the precipitation soaks into the ground, replenishing groundwater.
6. **Runoff:** Water flows over the surface of the land, returning to rivers, lakes, and eventually the oceans.
7. **Percolation:** Water moves downward through soil and rock layers, replenishing aquifers.

The cycle is driven by solar energy and gravity, and it helps in the distribution of heat around the globe, supporting all forms of life.

- **Examples and Effects:**
    - **Lead:** Causes neurological damage and developmental issues in children.
    - **Mercury:** Accumulates in the food chain, leading to mercury poisoning.
    - **Cadmium:** Causes kidney damage and bone fractures.
    - **Arsenic:** Linked to skin lesions, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.

#### Pesticides

- **Origin:** ==Agricultural runoff from the use of chemicals to control pests==.
- **Effects:** Pesticides can be toxic to aquatic life, disrupt reproductive systems, and accumulate in the food chain, affecting both wildlife and humans.

#### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

- **Origin:** ==Industrial solvents, fuel spills, and the improper disposal of household chemicals==.
- **Effects:** VOCs can cause cancer, liver damage, and kidney damage. They also contaminate groundwater and can make water unsafe for consumption.

# BOD Test (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)

#### What is BOD?

- **Definition:** BOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic microorganisms to decompose the organic matter in water over a specific period, typically five days (BOD₅) at a controlled temperature (usually 20°C).
- **Purpose:** It measures the amount of biodegradable organic material in water, indicating the level of pollution.

#### Procedure:

1. **Sample Collection:** Water samples are collected in airtight bottles to prevent any loss of dissolved oxygen or contamination.
2. **Initial DO Measurement:** The dissolved oxygen (DO) level is measured immediately after collection using a DO meter.
3. **Incubation:** The sample is then incubated in the dark at 20°C for five days to prevent photosynthesis, which could alter DO levels.
4. **Final DO Measurement:** After the incubation period, the DO level is measured again.
5. **BOD Calculation:** The BOD value is calculated by subtracting the final DO from the initial DO. This value represents the amount of oxygen consumed by microorganisms during the incubation period.
![Pasted image 20240622022053.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240622022053.png)

#### Significance:

- **Low BOD:** Indicates good water quality with low levels of organic pollution.
- **High BOD:** Suggests high levels of organic pollution, leading to oxygen depletion which can harm aquatic life.

# Seeded BOD Test

#### Why Seeded BOD Test?

In some cases, water samples may not contain enough microorganisms to decompose the organic matter effectively. This could be due to the water source, such as highly treated wastewater or water with low microbial activity. The Seeded BOD test adds a known microbial population (seed) to the sample to ensure proper decomposition of organic matter.

#### Procedure:

1. **Preparation of Seed:** Microorganisms are cultivated from a source like treated wastewater, which is rich in bacteria capable of degrading organic matter. This culture is aerated and allowed to grow for a few days.
2. **Sample Preparation:** Water samples are prepared as in the standard BOD test.
3. **Addition of Seed:** A small volume of the prepared seed culture is added to the water samples to ensure an adequate microbial population.
4. **Initial DO Measurement:** The DO level of the seeded sample is measured.
5. **Incubation:** The sample is incubated at 20°C for five days in the dark.
6. **Final DO Measurement:** The DO level is measured again after incubation.
7. **BOD Calculation:** The BOD value is calculated similarly by subtracting the final DO from the initial DO.

![Pasted image 20240622022132.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240622022132.png)

#### Corrections for Seed Control:

To account for the oxygen demand of the seed itself, a seed control (a blank sample containing only seed in dilution water) is also incubated and its BOD is measured. This value is subtracted from the BOD of the seeded sample to get the true BOD of the water sample.

![Pasted image 20240622022148.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240622022148.png)

#### Importance:

- **Accuracy:** The Seeded BOD test provides more accurate BOD values for samples with low or absent microbial populations.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that the BOD test results are consistent and reliable, regardless of the sample’s initial microbial content.
