# Definition of Noise

**Noise**:

- Noise is typically ==defined as any unwanted or disturbing sound that interferes with normal activities== such as sleeping, conversation, or other routine activities.
- From a scientific perspective, noise is a type of sound characterized by its irregular waveform and lack of harmonic content compared to musical sounds.
- Noise ==can be subjective==; ==what is considered noise to one person might not be to another==. For example, loud music might be pleasant to some but disturbing to others.

### Effects of Noise Pollution

**Health Effects**:

- **Hearing Loss**: ==Prolonged exposure to high noise levels can cause permanent hearing damage==.
- **Stress and Anxiety**: Continuous exposure to noise ==can increase stress levels==, leading to anxiety and related disorders.
- **Cardiovascular Issues**: Elevated noise levels can lead to ==high blood pressure==, increased heart rate, and a higher risk of heart diseases.
- **Sleep Disturbances**: Noise ==can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to fatigue==, decreased productivity, and overall poor health.
- **Cognitive Effects**: Particularly in children, ==noise pollution can affect learning and concentration==, leading to decreased cognitive performance.

**Environmental Effects**:

- **Wildlife Disruption**: Many ==animals rely on sound for communication, navigation==, and detecting predators. ==Noise pollution can interfere with these essential activities, affecting animal behavior and survival==.
- **Quality of Life**: Excessive noise can reduce the quality of life by interfering with daily activities, reducing property values, and causing psychological stress.
- **Communication Interference**: Noise pollution can make verbal communication difficult, leading to misunderstandings and reduced social interaction.

# Noise classification

**Transport Noise**:

- **Road Traffic Noise**: ==Includes sounds from cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses==. This is often the most pervasive type of noise in urban environments.
- **Air Traffic Noise**: Noise from ==airplanes during takeoff, landing, and while flying over== populated areas.
- **Rail Traffic Noise**: Noise ==generated by trains, including engine noise==, wheel-rail interaction, and signal horns.

**Occupational Noise**:

- **Industrial Noise**: ==Noise from machinery, tools, and industrial processes== commonly found in factories and manufacturing plants.
- **Construction Noise**: Sounds from ==construction sites, including heavy machinery==, demolition, and building activities.
- **Office Noise**: In some cases, ==office environments can have significant noise from equipment like printers, telephones==, and HVAC systems.

**Neighborhood Noise**:

- **Residential Noise**: Includes ==loud music, television sounds, and household appliances== like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.
- **Social Noise**: ==Noise from social gatherings, parties==, and public events.
- **Animal Noise**: ==Sounds from pets such as barking dogs== and other domestic animals.
- **Miscellaneous Noise**: Other types of noise that can be found in residential areas, such as lawn mowers, leaf blowers, and car alarms.

# Noise Frequency, Pressure and Intensity

**Noise Frequency**:

- **Definition**: ==Frequency is the number of sound wave cycles that pass a fixed point per second. It is measured in Hertz== (Hz).
- **Perception**: Frequency ==determines the pitch of the sound==. ==Higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds, while lower frequencies correspond to lower-pitched sounds==.
- **Range**: ==Humans can generally hear frequencies from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz)==. Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, and sounds above 20 kHz are called ultrasound.
- **Examples**:
    - A low-frequency noise could be a deep rumble from thunder or heavy machinery.
    - A high-frequency noise could be a whistle or the sound of a mosquito.

### Noise Pressure

**Noise Pressure (Sound Pressure)**:

- **Definition**: Sound pressure is the local pressure deviation from the ambient (average or equilibrium) ==atmospheric pressure caused by a sound wave==. It is ==measured in Pascals (Pa).==
- **Perception**: The ==amplitude of the sound pressure wave determines the loudness of the sound. Greater sound pressure corresponds to louder sounds==.
- **Measurement**: Sound pressure level (SPL) is often measured in decibels (dB), which is a logarithmic scale. SPL is calculated using the formula:
- ![Pasted image 20240621233802.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240621233802.png)

- **Examples**:
    - Normal conversation has a sound pressure level of around 60 db.
    - A rock concert might have levels around 110-120 db.

### Noise Intensity

**Noise Intensity (Sound Intensity)**:

- **Definition**: ==Sound intensity is the sound power per unit area, which quantifies the energy of the sound wave. It is measured in watts per square meter== (W/m²).
- **Perception**: ==Intensity is also related to loudness, but it is a measure of energy transfer rather than pressure==.
- **Measurement**: Like sound pressure level, sound intensity level can also be expressed in decibels (dB), using the formula:

![Pasted image 20240621233829.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240621233829.png)

- **Examples**:
    - Whispering has a low intensity, around 10−1210^{-12}10−12 W/m².
    - A jet engine at close range can have an intensity of 10−210^{-2}10−2 W/m² or higher.

### Summary of Differences

- **Frequency** is about the rate of sound wave cycles per second and determines the pitch of the sound.
- **Pressure** is about the force of the sound wave on a surface and determines the loudness of the sound.
- **Intensity** is about the energy transfer of the sound wave per unit area and also relates to the loudness of the sound.

# Noise Threshold limit value, equivalent noise level

### Noise Threshold Limit Value (TLV)

**Noise Threshold Limit Value (TLV)**:

- **Definition**: The Noise Threshold Limit Value (TLV) ==represents the maximum permissible noise exposure level for a specified period, usually to protect workers' hearing and health. It is set by regulatory agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)==.
- **Measurement**: TLVs are often measured in decibels (dB) over a standardized period, such as an 8-hour workday.
- **Examples**:
    - OSHA's ==permissible exposure limit (PEL) for workplace noise is 90 dB for an 8-hour day==.
    - For every 5 dB increase in noise level, the allowable exposure time is halved. For instance, at 95 dB, the maximum exposure time is 4 hours.
- **Purpose**: The TLV is ==designed to prevent hearing loss and other health issues== associated with prolonged exposure to high noise levels.

### Equivalent Noise Level (Leq) (only study if you have time)

**Equivalent Noise Level (Leq)**:

- **Definition**: The Equivalent Noise Level (Leq) is a single number that represents the constant noise level that would have the same acoustic energy as the varying noise levels measured over a specific period.
- **Calculation**: Leq is calculated using the formula:
![Pasted image 20240621234327.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240621234327.png)

- **Examples**:
    - If the noise levels fluctuate between 50 dB and 70 dB over an hour, the Leq might be around 65 dB, representing the average energy level of the noise.
    
- **Usage**: Leq is widely used in environmental noise assessments, urban planning, and noise control engineering because it provides a comprehensive measure of exposure over time.

# Noise pollution control

**Noise Pollution Control**:

- **Source Control**:
    - **Design and Engineering**: Using ==quieter machinery and equipment==, implementing better engine designs, and adding noise-reducing features.
    - **Maintenance**: Regular maintenance of machinery and vehicles to ensure they operate quietly.
- **Path Control**:
    - **Barriers**: ==Installing sound barriers such as walls, fences, or earthen berms== to block or absorb noise.
    - **Vegetation**: ==Planting trees and shrubs can help to attenuate noise== by providing a physical barrier.
    - **Distance**: Increasing the distance between the noise source and the receiver.
- **Receiver Control**:
    - **Soundproofing**: ==Installing double-glazed windows, insulation, and soundproofing materials in buildings== to reduce noise penetration.
    - **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: ==Providing earplugs or earmuffs to workers in noisy environments==.
- **Administrative and Regulatory Measures**:
    - **Zoning Laws**: ==Implementing zoning laws to separate industrial areas from residential areas==.
    - **Noise Ordinances**: Establishing and enforcing noise limits for different areas and times of day.
    - **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Educating the public about the sources and effects of noise pollution and encouraging behaviors that reduce noise.
