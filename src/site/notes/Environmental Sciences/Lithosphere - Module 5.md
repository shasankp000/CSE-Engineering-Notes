![Pasted image 20240621224657.png](/img/user/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240621224657.png)

### Internal Structure of the Earth

The Earth's internal structure is divided into several layers:

1. **Crust**:
    
    - **Continental Crust**: ==Thicker and less dense, composed mostly of granite==.
    - **Oceanic Crust**: ==Thinner and more dense, composed mostly of basalt==.
    - The crust is the outermost layer and is where we live. It varies in thickness from about 5 km (under the oceans) to about 70 km (under continents).
1. **Mantle**:
    
    - Comprises about ==84% of Earth's volume==.
    - ==Divided into the upper mantle and lower mantle==.
    - Composed of ==silicate minerals== that are ==rich in magnesium and iron==.
    - The upper mantle includes the asthenosphere, which is semi-fluid and allows tectonic plates to move.
3. **Core**:
    
    - **Outer Core**: ==Liquid layer composed mainly of iron and nickel. It creates Earth's magnetic field through its movement==.
    - **Inner Core**: ==Solid, due to the immense pressures, composed primarily of iron and nickel. It is the hottest part of the Earth==.

### Rock Types

Rocks are classified based on their formation processes:

1. **Igneous Rocks**:
    
    - ==Formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava==.
    - **Intrusive Igneous Rocks**: Formed from magma that cools slowly beneath the Earth’s surface (e.g., granite).
    - **Extrusive Igneous Rocks**: Formed from lava that cools quickly on the Earth’s surface (e.g., basalt).
2. **Sedimentary Rocks**:
    
    - ==Formed from the accumulation and lithification of sediments==.
    - ==Often contain fossils and are usually layered==.
    - Examples include sandstone, limestone, and shale.
3. **Metamorphic Rocks**:
    
    - ==Formed from existing rocks that are subjected to heat and pressure, causing physical and chemical changes==.
    - Examples include slate (from shale), marble (from limestone), and gneiss (from granite).

### Soil

Soil is a ==natural resource composed of mineral particles, organic matter, water, and air==. It forms through the ==weathering of rocks and the decay of organic material over time==. Key aspects of soil include:

1. **Soil Horizons**:
    
    - **O Horizon**: Organic layer composed of decomposed leaves and organic material.
    - **A Horizon (Topsoil)**: Rich in organic material and minerals, crucial for plant growth.
    - **B Horizon (Subsoil)**: Accumulates minerals leached from the topsoil and contains more clay.
    - **C Horizon**: Consists of weathered parent material.
    - **R Horizon**: Unweathered bedrock.
    
2. **Soil Composition**:
    
    - **Mineral Particles**: Derived from the breakdown of rocks; classified into sand, silt, and clay based on size.
    - **Organic Matter**: Decomposed plant and animal material that enriches the soil.
    - **Water and Air**: Fill the spaces between soil particles and are essential for soil health and plant growth.
    
3. ==**Soil Types**==:
    
    - **Sandy Soil**: Drains quickly but has low nutrient retention.
    - **Clay Soil**: High nutrient content but poor drainage.
    - **Loamy Soil**: Balanced mixture of sand, silt, and clay; ideal for agriculture.

# Solid Waste

## What is solid waste?

Solid waste is the type of waste which is, well, solid in nature (duh).

# Types of solid wastes

- **Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)**:
    
    - ==Includes everyday items discarded by the public==, such as household garbage, packaging, food scraps, yard waste, and broken furniture.
    - Generated from residential, commercial, and institutional sources.
    
- **Industrial Waste**:
    
    - ==Generated by manufacturing or industrial processes==.
    - Includes materials such as scraps, chemicals, plastics, metals, and sludge.
    - Often contains hazardous substances requiring special disposal methods.
    
- **Commercial Waste**:
    
    - ==Produced by businesses such as retail stores, offices, restaurants, and service providers==.
    - Includes packaging materials, office supplies, food waste, and old equipment.
    
- **Agricultural Waste**:
    
    - ==Generated from farming and agricultural activities==.
    - Includes crop residues, manure, pesticide containers, and unused fertilizers.
    - Often biodegradable but can contain chemicals that need careful management.
    
- **Domestic Waste**:
    
    - ==Household waste similar to municipal waste but specifically from residential areas==.
    - Includes food scraps, paper, plastics, glass, metals, textiles, and household hazardous waste (e.g., batteries, cleaning products).
    
- **Pathological and Hazardous Solid Wastes**:
    
    - **Pathological Waste**: ==Includes medical waste such as human tissues, organs, and body fluids==.
    - **Hazardous Waste**: ==Waste that poses substantial or potential threats to public health or the environment, such as toxic chemicals==, solvents, pesticides, and radioactive materials.

# Recovery and Disposal methods

- **Open Dumping**:
    
    - ==Uncontrolled disposal of waste in open areas==.
    - Can lead to environmental pollution, ==health hazards==, and aesthetic issues.
    - ==Illegal in many places== due to its negative impacts.
    
- **Land Filling**:
    
    - ==Controlled disposal of waste by burying it in designated areas known as landfills==.
    - Modern landfills are engineered to minimize environmental impact, including lining systems to ==prevent leachate from contaminating groundwater and methane capture systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions==.
    - Regular monitoring and maintenance are required.
    
- **Incineration**:
    
    - ==Burning of waste materials at high temperatures to reduce volume== and destroy hazardous components.
    - Can generate energy (waste-to-energy facilities) but ==may produce air pollutants== and ash that require disposal.
    
- **Composting**:
    
    - ==Biological decomposition of organic waste (e.g., food scraps, yard waste) under controlled conditions to produce compost==.
    - ==Compost can be used as a soil conditioner to enhance soil health and fertility==.
    - ==Reduces the amount of organic waste sent to landfills==.
    
- **Recycling**:
    
    - ==Processing of waste materials to make them suitable for reuse==.
    - Includes the collection, sorting, and reprocessing of materials like paper, cardboard, glass, metals, and plastics.
    - ==Conserves natural resources, reduces energy consumption, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions==.

# Solid Waste Management and Control

- **Hazardous and Biomedical Waste Management**:
    
    - **Hazardous Waste**: ==Managed through special protocols to ensure safe handling, storage, treatment, and disposal to minimize risks to human health== and the environment.
        - Methods include secure landfilling, incineration, chemical treatment, and bioremediation.
    - **Biomedical Waste**: ==Includes waste from hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and research facilities==.
        - Requires segregation, containment, disinfection, and proper disposal to prevent infection and contamination.
        - Common methods include autoclaving, incineration, and chemical disinfection.
- **Integrated Waste Management (IWM)**:
    
    - A comprehensive approach to managing solid waste that combines various methods and strategies.
    - Focuses on reducing waste generation, increasing recycling and composting, and ensuring safe disposal of remaining waste.
    - Encourages the use of a hierarchy: reduce, reuse, recycle, recover energy, and dispose as a last resort.
- **Waste Minimization**:
    
    - Strategies to reduce the amount and toxicity of waste generated.
    - Includes process modifications, resource efficiency, and product design improvements.
    - Encourages consumers and businesses to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their environmental footprint.
